 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Bringing Enhanced Treatments and Therapies to ESRD Recipients Kidney Care Act  or the  BETTER Kidney Care Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) Although the relative rate of end-stage renal disease (referred to in this section as  ESRD ) among the Nation’s minority populations has declined, significant disparities remain. Compared to Whites, Black Americans are 2.6 times more likely to have kidney failure, while Native Americans and Alaska Natives are 1.2 times more likely. Hispanics are 1.3 times more likely to have kidney failure compared to non-Hispanics. (2)  Disparities also exist with respect to treatment modalities. Specifically, although home dialysis can offer advantages, Black, Hispanic, and Native American and Alaska Native ESRD patients are less likely to initiate home treatment than White ESRD patients.  (3)  Numerous studies show that individuals with low incomes and in low-income communities are at greater risk for ESRD.  (4)  In addition to their kidney disease, ESRD patients across all races and ethnicities often suffer from one or more comorbidities. Eighty-eight percent of ESRD patients have a history of hypertension, 42 percent have diabetes, and nearly 30 percent have congestive heart failure.  (5)  Each month, ESRD patients see multiple providers and take several medications to manage their kidney disease and comorbid conditions. Of all patients, those with ESRD stand to benefit greatly from better coordinated care.  (6)  The Executive order on Advancing American Kidney Health recognizes the need to develop and implement new ESRD care delivery models to improve quality and value for ESRD patients and the Medicare program.  (7)  In alignment with that goal, it is imperative that Medicare test new models that have at their core an interdisciplinary care team, among other structural requirements, to—  (A)  help ESRD patients better navigate the health care system;   (B)  empower such patients to manage their plan of care and medication regimen;   (C)  support such patients in receiving the treatment modality, including a kidney transplant, as prescribed by their nephrologist;   (D)  access services to meet the nonclinical needs of such patients that can affect care outcomes; and  (E)  receive additional services, such as transplant evaluation, palliative care, evaluation for hospice eligibility, and vascular access care. 
 3.
