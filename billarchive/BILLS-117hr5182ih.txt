 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  White House Accountability for Language Diversity Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  In the past decades it has become standard practice to publish versions of the White House and other agency websites in Spanish.  (2)  At least 36,000,000 United States residents who speak Spanish as their first language depend upon these websites to access important information that can play a critical role in their life.  (3)  In 2010, for 59,000,000 people, English was not their first language.  (4)  In addition to English, the top languages in the United States are Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and French.  (5)  Millions of people within the United States will benefit by having websites translated into multiple languages.  (6)  The United States of America is a diverse Nation and, as such, does not have an official language.  (7)  Since our founding, our country has been in a constant state of growth. We have consistently grown more multilingual because of people from across the world seeking a better future while carrying a hope of achieving the American dream.  (8)  As this is happening, the United States must adapt and make our democracy more accessible for everyone. 
 3.  Purpose  The purpose of this Act is toâ€”  (1)  require the White House and agencies to provide resources in multiple languages so that people can read information in the language they are most comfortable with; and  (2)  acknowledge the diversity of our country and use creative solutions to make sure that there is equity in accessing information from our government.
