 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 2021 .
 2.  Sense of congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  if current trends continue, average global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2050;  (2)  global temperature rise has already resulted in an increased number of heavy rainstorms, coastal flooding events, heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme events;  (3)  since 1980—  (A)  the number of extreme weather events per year that cost the people of the United States more than $1,000,000,000 per event, accounting for inflation, has increased significantly; and  (B)  the total cost of extreme weather events in the United States has exceeded $1,875,000,000,000;  (4)  as physical impacts from climate change are manifested across multiple sectors of the economy of the United States—  (A)  climate-related economic risks will continue to increase;  (B)  climate-related extreme weather events will disrupt energy and transportation systems in the United States, which will result in more frequent and longer-lasting power outages, fuel shortages, and service disruptions in critical sectors across the economy of the United States;  (C)  projected increases in extreme heat conditions will lead to decreases in labor productivity in agriculture, construction, and other critical economic sectors;  (D)  food and livestock production will be impacted in regions that experience increases in heat and drought and small rural communities will struggle to find the resources needed to adapt to those changes; and  (E)  sea level rise and more frequent and intense extreme weather events will—  (i)  increasingly disrupt and damage private property and critical infrastructure; and  (ii)  drastically increase insured and uninsured losses;  (5)  advances in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, as well as climate policies and shifting societal preferences, will—  (A)  reduce global demand for fossil fuels; and  (B)  expose transition risks for fossil fuel companies and investors, and for companies and investors in other energy-intensive industries, which could include trillions of dollars of stranded assets around the world;  (6)  climate change poses uniquely far-reaching risks to the financial services industry, including with respect to credit, counterparty, and market risks, due to the number of sectors and locations impacted and the potentially irreversible scale of damage;  (7)  financial institutions must take a consistent approach to assessing climate-related financial risks and incorporating those risks into existing risk management practices, which should be informed by scenario analysis;  (8) the Board of Governors conducts annual assessments of the capital adequacy and capital planning practices of the largest and most complex banking organizations (referred to in this section as  stress tests ) in order to promote a safe, sound, and efficient banking and financial system; (9)  as of the date of enactment of this Act, the stress tests conducted by the Board of Governors are not designed to reflect the physical risks or transition risks posed by climate change;   (10)  the Board of Governors—  (A)  has the authority to take into account the potentially systemic impact of climate-related risks on the financial system; and  (B)  should develop new analytical tools with longer time horizons to accurately assess and manage the risks described in subparagraph (A); and  (11) the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has identified the importance of researching climate-related  sub-systemic  shocks to financial markets and institutions in particular sectors and regions of the United States.

(ii)  Tests  (I)  In general Subject to the other requirements of this clause, the Board of Governors, in coordination with the appropriate primary financial regulatory agencies and the climate science leads, shall conduct biennial analyses in which each covered entity is subject to evaluation, under an adverse set of conditions, of whether that covered entity has the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to absorb financial losses that would arise under each climate change risk scenario developed under section 5 of the  Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 2021 . (II)  Initial tests  With respect to each of the first 3 analyses conducted under subclause (I)—  (aa)  the covered entity to which such an analysis applies shall not be subject to any adverse consequences as a result of the analysis; and  (bb)  the Board of Governors shall—  (AA)  not later than 60 days after the date on which the Board of Governors completes each such analysis, make a summary of the analysis publicly available; and  (BB)  submit a copy of the results of the analysis to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.

(dd)  General distribution limitation  If the Board of Governors, under item (cc), objects to a climate risk remediation plan submitted by a covered entity under item (aa), the covered entity may not make any capital distribution, other than a capital distribution arising from the issuance of a regulatory capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a minimum regulatory capital ratio.  .  
 7.  Sub-systemic exploratory survey  (a)  Development of survey  The Board of Governors, in consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, shall develop an exploratory survey to assess—  (1)  the ability of surveyed entities, including agricultural banks, community banks, and other financial institutions with a significant concentration of business activities in certain geographical areas or industries, to withstand each climate risk scenario developed under section 5; and  (2)  how surveyed entities plan to make adaptations to the business models and capital planning of those entities in response to the risks presented in each climate change risk scenario developed under section 5.  (b)  Administration of survey  (1)  Initial administration  (A)  In general Not later than 1 year after the completion of the first analysis under subparagraph (C) of section 165(i)(1) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 ( 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(1) ), as added by section 6 of this Act, the Board of Governors shall administer the survey developed under subsection (a) to each surveyed entity.
