 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  according to the Department of Justice, every year, over 600,000 individuals are released from prison and return home to their communities, and almost 77 percent of those individuals will reoffend within 5 years;  (2)  according to the Center for American Progress, an estimated 60 percent of formerly incarcerated individuals will remain unemployed for a period of 1 year post-incarceration, increasing the risk for recidivism;  (3)  according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the economy of the United States loses an estimated $78,000,000,000 to $87,000,000,000 annually due to lost output from individuals with criminal records unable to find stable employment;  (4)  entrepreneurial development programs for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals report dramatically lower rates of recidivism; and  (5)  self-employment can provide economic stability for those who are otherwise locked out of the labor market.
