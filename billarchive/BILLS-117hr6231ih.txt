  2.  Study on potential pilot program to support medical residency and fellowship programs that assist veterans   (a)  Sense of Congress  It is the Sense of Congress that— 
 (1)  the COVID–19 pandemic and other factors have contributed to a growing backlog of veterans needing medical disability examinations and opinions;   (2)  access to medical disability examinations and opinions is critical for veterans to receive disability compensation benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs; 
 (3)  there remains a need to train non-Department of Veterans Affairs clinicians to understand and support the unique medical needs of disabled veterans;   (4)  veterans who are dissatisfied with medical disability examinations or opinions provided by employees or contractors of the Department of Veterans Affairs may obtain and submit outside, independent disability evaluations; however, most veterans cannot afford to obtain such evaluations and most non-Department training clinicians are not familiar with the specific legal criteria and medical findings necessary to prepare adequate disability examination reports and opinions; and 
 (5)  clinics within non-Department of Veterans Affairs medical residency and fellowship programs are a potential resource to supplement the current medical disability examination and opinion system carried out by employees and contractors of the Department by—   (A)  affording disabled veterans with another option for high-quality, outside, independent disability evaluations; and 
 (B)  providing non-Department clinicians with clinical training and experience necessary to understand the unique medical needs of disabled veterans.   (b)  Study required  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall conduct a study to assess the feasibility and advisability of—
