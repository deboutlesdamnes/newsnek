 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Improving Chassis Capacity for Memphis’ Supply Chain Act .
 2.  Development of operating model for interoperable gray chassis pool at the rail ramps around Memphis, Tennessee  (a)  Definitions  In this section:  (1)  Commission The term  Commission  means the Federal Maritime Commission. (2)  Interoperable gray chassis pool The term  interoperable gray chassis pool  means a single enterprise for voluntary chassis provisioning that allows for the use of any container chassis for marine shipping containers not less than 20 feet and not more than 45 feet in length at the rail ramps around Memphis, Tennessee, by shippers or motor carriers. (b)  Development of plan  (1)  In general  Subject to the availability of appropriations, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Commission, shall develop a plan to issue a request for proposals to develop an operating model for an interoperable gray chassis pool at the rail ramps around Memphis, Tennessee.  (2)  Plan details  In developing the plan under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Commission, shall identify a suitable location or locations for the interoperable gray chassis pool and consult with relevant stakeholders, including the International Port of Memphis, ocean carriers, railroad carriers, motor carriers, chassis providers, shippers, and the Surface Transportation Board.  (3)  Content of plan and availability  The plan under paragraph (1) shall—  (A)  include—  (i)  objectives and duties of a private sector entity to establish the interoperable gray chassis pool;  (ii)  expectations for voluntary participation based on consultations; and  (iii)  the appropriate approach for seeking and receiving feedback from Memphis stakeholders regarding the interoperable gray chassis pool; and  (B)  be publicly available on a website not later than 7 days after the plan is completed.  (c)  Request for proposals  (1)  In general  Subject to the availability of appropriations, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Commission, shall issue a request for proposals for a private sector entity to develop an operating model for an interoperable gray chassis pool consistent with the plan required under subsection (b).  (2)  Content of proposal  A proposal submitted pursuant to a request under paragraph (1) shall include—  (A)  a fee structure that would sustain the interoperable gray chassis pool without a subsidy;  (B)  specification of performance goals, including rates of chassis in maintenance and average turn times, and a plan to achieve the performance goals;  (C)  expectations for communication and coordination among carriers and local businesses, including any facilitation by the private sector entity;  (D)  expectations for total chassis involved, whether from voluntary participation of existing providers or addition of chassis by the private sector entity;  (E)  identification of real property necessary to implement the interoperable gray chassis pool, whether from voluntary participants or to be acquired; and  (F)  a commitment from the private sector entity to implement the interoperable gray chassis pool at the rail ramps around Memphis, Tennessee, based on the operating model developed for the proposal within a specified timeframe.  (d)  Awarding of contract  (1)  In general  Subject to the availability of appropriations, except as provided in paragraph (2), from the proposals submitted under subsection (c), the Secretary of Transportation, with approval from the Commission, shall award a contract to a private sector entity to develop and implement an operating model for an interoperable gray chassis pool at the rail ramps around Memphis, Tennessee.  (2)  No satisfactory proposal  If no satisfactory proposal is submitted under subsection (c), the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Commission, shall submit, not later than 6 months after the date on which all proposals are submitted, a report to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives with potential alternative options to improve chassis provisioning and supply chain efficiency at the rail ramps around Memphis, Tennessee.
