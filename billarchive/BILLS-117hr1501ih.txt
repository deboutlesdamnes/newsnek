 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Affordable Housing Redevelopment Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  even before the economic hardship caused by the COVID–19 pandemic, the United States faced a shortage of more than 7,000,000 affordable rental homes to meet the needs of extremely low-income renters;  (2)  due to financial burdens and loss of income resulting from the pandemic, millions of people in the United States are at risk of eviction or foreclosure, and the need for affordable housing is expected to increase dramatically;  (3)  homelessness is projected to rise by as much as 45 percent across the United States as a result of the pandemic and economic crisis, meaning nearly 1,000,000 people in the United States could be experiencing homelessness in the very near future;  (4)  in addition to making long-term investments in the affordable housing stock in the United States, it is also critically important to focus resources on more immediate solutions, such as acquiring and rehabilitating existing buildings and placing affordability requirements on the housing that is produced;  (5)  acquisition and rehabilitation provides two distinct advantages by lowering per-unit construction costs and making affordable housing units available to low-income households much faster;  (6)  in addition to rehabilitation of residential properties, there are opportunities for adaptive reuse and the conversion of non-residential office and retail properties to create new affordable housing in communities across the United States; and   (7)  helping States, local governments, and nonprofit organizations acquire blighted, abandoned, vacant, foreclosed, or surplus properties and convert them into affordable housing will allow for the rapid development of new affordable units, while stimulating local economies and creating jobs.
