 2.  Findings; purposes  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) The Taiwan Relations Act ( Public Law 96–8 ;  22 U.S.C. 3301  et seq.) affirmed United States policy  to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland and all other peoples of the Western Pacific area . (2) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 ( Public Law 115–409 ), the United States has grown its strategic partnership with Taiwan’s vibrant democracy of 23,000,000 people. (3)  Despite a concerted campaign by the People’s Republic of China to isolate Taiwan from its diplomatic partners and from international organizations, including the World Health Organization, Taiwan has emerged as a global leader in the coronavirus global pandemic response, including by donating more than 2,000,000 surgical masks and other medical equipment to the United States.  (4)  The creation of a United States fellowship program with Taiwan would support—  (A)  a key priority of expanding people-to-people exchanges, which was outlined in President Donald J. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy;  (B) President Joseph R. Biden’s commitment to Taiwan,  a leading democracy and a critical economic and security partner , as expressed in his March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance; and (C) April 2021 guidance from the Department of State based on a review required under the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (subtitle B of title III of division FF of  Public Law 116–260 ) to  encourage U.S. government engagement with Taiwan that reflects our deepening unofficial relationship . (b)  Purposes  The purposes of this Act are—  (1)  to further strengthen the United States-Taiwan strategic partnership and broaden understanding of the Indo-Pacific region by temporarily assigning officials of agencies of the United States Government to Taiwan for intensive study in Mandarin Chinese and placement as Fellows with the governing authorities on Taiwan or a Taiwanese civic institution;  (2)  to expand United States Government expertise in Mandarin Chinese language skills and understanding of the politics, history, and culture of Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region by providing eligible United States personnel the opportunity to acquire such skills and understanding through the Taiwan Fellowship Program established under section 3; and  (3)  to better position the United States to advance its economic, security, and human rights interests and values in the Indo-Pacific region.
