 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Investor Choice Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Investor confidence in fair and equitable recourse is essential to the health and stability of the securities markets and to the participation of retail investors in those markets.  (2)  Issuers, brokers, dealers, and investment advisers hold powerful advantages over investors, and mandatory arbitration clauses, including contracts that force investors to submit claims to arbitration or to waive the right of investors to participate in a class action lawsuit, leverage those advantages to severely restrict the ability of defrauded investors to seek redress.  (3)  Investors should be free to—  (A)  choose arbitration to resolve disputes if they judge that arbitration truly offers them the best opportunity to efficiently and fairly settle disputes; and  (B)  pursue remedies in court should they view that option as superior to arbitration.
