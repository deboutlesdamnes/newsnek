 2.  Transnational repression accountability and prevention  (a)  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  The International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) works to prevent and fight crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters, including kleptocracy, counterterrorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and transnational organized crime.   (2)  United States membership and participation in INTERPOL advances the national security and law enforcement interests of the United States related to combating kleptocracy, terrorism, cybercrime, narcotics, and transnational organized crime.   (3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution states that the organization aims [to] ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities … in the spirit of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights . (4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution states that  [i]t is strictly forbidden for the Organization to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character . (5)  These principles provide INTERPOL with a foundation based on respect for human rights and avoidance of politically motivated actions by the organization and its members.  (6) According to the Justice Manual of the United States Department of Justice,  [i]n the United States, national law prohibits the arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued by another INTERPOL member country, based upon the notice alone .  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that some INTERPOL member countries have repeatedly misused INTERPOL's databases and processes, including Notice and Diffusion mechanisms, for activities of an overtly political or other unlawful character and in violation of international human rights standards, including making requests to harass or persecute political opponents, human rights defenders, or journalists.
