(d)  International Harmonization  After issuing the final guidance under subsection (b), the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, may work with foreign regulators pursuant to existing memoranda of understanding governing exchange of information to facilitate international harmonization of the regulation of decentralized clinical trials and use of digital health technology or other remote assessment options. 
 3.  Encouragement of clinical trial enrollment by racially and ethnically diverse populations  (a)  No cost provision of digital health technologies The free provision of digital health technologies by drug or device manufacturers to their clinical trial participants shall not be considered a violation of section 1128A of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the  Civil Monetary Penalties Law ) ( 42 U.S.C. 1320a–7a ), section 1128B of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b ), or sections 3729 through 3733 of title 31, United States Code, (commonly known as the  False Claims Act ), provided that— (1)  the use of digital health technologies will facilitate in any phase of clinical development the inclusion of diversity of patient populations, such as underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, low-income populations, and the elderly;  (2)  the digital health technologies will facilitate individuals participation, or are necessary to such participation;  (3)  all features of the digital health technologies that are unrelated to use in the clinical trial are disabled or only allowed to remain activated to model real-world usage of the digital technology; and  (4)  the clinical trial sponsor requires participants to return, purchase, or disable the digital health technologies by the conclusion of the trial.  (b)  Grants and contracts  (1)  In general  The Secretary may issue grants to and enter into contracts with entities to support community education, outreach, and recruitment activities for clinical trials with respect to drugs, including vaccines for diseases or conditions which have a disproportionate impact on underrepresented populations (including on racial and ethnic minority populations), including for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of COVID–19. Such activities may include—   (A)  working with community clinical trial sites, including community health centers, academic health centers, and other facilities;  (B)  training health care personnel including potential clinical trial investigators, with a focus on significantly increasing the number of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority healthcare personnel who are clinical trial investigators at the community sites for ongoing clinical trials;  (C)  engaging community stakeholders to encourage participation in clinical trials, especially in underrepresented racial and ethnic minority communities; and  (D)  fostering partnerships with community-based organizations serving underrepresented racial and ethnical minority populations, including employee unions and frontline health care workers.  (2)  Priority for grant and contract awards  In awarding grants and contracts under this subsection, the Secretary shall prioritize entities that—  (A)  develop educational, recruitment, and training materials in multiple languages; or  (B)  undertake clinical trial outreach efforts in more diverse racial and ethnic communities that are traditionally underrepresented in clinical trials, such as tribal areas.  (3)  Authorization of appropriations  There is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection.
