 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Preventing Future Pandemics Act of 2021 .
 2.  Wildlife market defined In this Act, the term  wildlife market — (1)  means a commercial market that—  (A)  sells or slaughters terrestrial, including avian, wildlife for human consumption as food or medicine, whether the animals originated in the wild or in a captive environment; and  (B)  delivers a product in communities where alternative nutritional or protein sources are available; and  (2)  does not include markets in areas where no other practical alternative sources of protein or meat exists, such as wildlife markets in rural areas on which indigenous people rely to feed themselves and their families. 
 3.  Study on risk of wildlife markets on the emergence of novel viral pathogens  (a)  In general  Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine under which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine agrees to conduct a study to evaluate—  (1)  the impact of physical proximity and consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine on the emergence of viral and other microbial pathogens;  (2)  the impact of consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine on the transmission of novel viral and other microbial pathogens;  (3)  the role consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine has on the transmission of microbes from animals to humans; and  (4)  the conditions at live wildlife markets that lead to transmission of zoonotic diseases.  (b)  Report  The agreement under subsection (a) shall require the National Academies to, not later than one year after the date of such agreement, submit a report to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives on the findings of the study conducted pursuant to subsection (a). 
 4.  International cooperation  (a)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that global institutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Health Organization (WHO), together with leading nongovernmental organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote the paradigm of One Health—the integration of human health, animal health, agriculture, ecosystems, and the environment as an effective and integrated way to address the complexity of emerging disease threats.  (b)  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States to facilitate international cooperation by working with international partners and through intergovernmental, international, and nongovernmental organizations such as the United Nations to—  (1)  lead a resolution at the United Nations Security Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly outlining the danger to human and animal health from emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, with recommendations for implementing the worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending of the associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed and supply those markets, except for in such countries or regions where the consumption of wildlife is necessary for local food security or where such actions would significantly disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food supply;  (2)  work with governments through existing treaties and the United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end the associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed and supply those markets while ensuring full consideration to the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and local communities that are dependent on wildlife for their food security, national sovereignty, and local laws and customs;  (3)  disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife markets and eliminate commercial wildlife markets;  (4)  disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking associated with the operation of wildlife markets;  (5)  raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID–19 and reduce demand for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior change programs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process;  (6)  encourage and support alternate forms of food production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, especially in areas where wildlife markets play a significant role in meeting subsistence needs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process; and  (7)  strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in markets around the globe, especially those specializing in the sale of products intended for human consumption.  (c)  Activities  (1)  Global prohibitions and enforcement  The United States Government, working through the United Nations and its components, as well as international organization such as Interpol and the World Organisation for Animal Health, and in furtherance of the policies described in subsection (b), shall—  (A)  collaboratively with other member states, issue declarations, statements, and communiques urging a global ban on commercial wildlife markets and trade for human consumption; and  (B)  urge increased enforcement of existing laws to end wildlife trafficking.  (2)  International coalitions  The Secretary of State shall seek to build international coalitions focused on ending commercial wildlife markets for human consumption and associated wildlife trade which feeds and supplies said markets, with a focus on the following efforts:  (A)  Providing assistance and advice to other governments in the adoption of legislation and regulations to close wildlife markets and trade for human consumption.  (B)  Creating economic pressure on wildlife markets and their supply chains to prevent their operation.  (C)  Providing assistance and guidance to other governments to prohibit the import, export, and domestic trade of live terrestrial wildlife for the purpose of human consumption.  (D)  Engaging and receiving guidance from key stakeholders at the ministerial, local government, and civil society level in countries that will be impacted by this Act and where wildlife markets and associated wildlife trafficking is the predominant source of meat or protein, in order to mitigate the impact of any international efforts on local customs, conservation methods, or cultural norms.
