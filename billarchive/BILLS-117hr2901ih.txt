(iii)  Establishment of a regional center  A regional center shall operate within a defined, contiguous, and limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal and be consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment within such area. The proposal to establish a regional center shall demonstrate that the pooled investment will have a substantive economic impact on such geographic area, and shall include— 
 (I)  reasonable predictions, supported by economically and statistically valid and transparent forecasting tools, concerning the amount of investment that will be pooled, the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive such investments, details of the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such investments, and other positive economic effects such investments will have;   (II)  a description of the policies and procedures in place reasonably designed to monitor new commercial enterprises and any associated job-creating entity to seek to ensure compliance with— 
 (aa)  all applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders of the United States, including immigration laws, criminal laws, and securities laws; and    (bb)  all securities laws of each State in which securities offerings will be conducted, investment advice will be rendered, or the offerors or offerees reside;

(iv)  Indirect job creation   (I)  In general  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall permit aliens seeking admission under this subparagraph to satisfy only up to 90 percent of the requirement under subparagraph (A)(ii) with jobs that are estimated to be created indirectly through investment under this paragraph in accordance with this subparagraph. An employee of the new commercial enterprise or job-creating entity may be considered to hold a job that has been directly created. 
 (II)  Construction activity lasting less than 2 years  If the jobs estimated to be created are created by construction activity lasting less than 2 years, the Secretary shall permit aliens seeking admission under this subparagraph to satisfy only up to 75 percent of the requirement under subparagraph (A)(ii) with jobs that are estimated to be created indirectly through investment under this paragraph in accordance with this subparagraph.   (v)  Compliance   (I)  In general  In determining compliance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall permit aliens seeking admission under this subparagraph to rely on economically and statistically valid methodologies for determining the number of jobs created by the program, including— 
 (aa)  jobs estimated to have been created directly, which may be verified using such methodologies; and   (bb)  consistent with this subparagraph, jobs estimated to have been directly or indirectly created through capital expenditures, revenues generated from increased exports, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment resulting from the program. 
 (II)  Job and investment requirements 
 (aa)  Relocated jobs  In determining compliance with the job creation requirement under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary of Homeland Security may include jobs estimated to be created under a methodology that attributes jobs to prospective tenants occupying commercial real estate created or improved by capital investments if the number of such jobs estimated to be created has been determined by an economically and statistically valid methodology and such jobs are not existing jobs that have been relocated.   (bb)  Publicly available bonds  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall prescribe regulations to ensure that alien investor capital may not be utilized, by a new commercial enterprise or otherwise, to purchase municipal bonds or any other bonds, if such bonds are available to the general public, either as part of a primary offering or from a secondary market. 
 (cc)  Construction activity jobs  If the number of direct jobs estimated to be created has been determined by an economically and statistically valid methodology, and such direct jobs are created by construction activity lasting less than 2 years, the number of such jobs that may be considered direct jobs for purposes of clause (iv) shall be calculated by multiplying the total number of such jobs estimated to be created by the fraction of the 2-year period that the construction activity lasts.    (vi)  Amendments  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall— 
 (I)  require a regional center—   (aa)  to notify the Secretary, not later than 120 days before the implementation of significant proposed changes to its organizational structure, ownership, or administration, including the sale of such center, or other arrangements which would result in individuals not previously subject to the requirements under subparagraph (H) becoming involved with the regional center; or
