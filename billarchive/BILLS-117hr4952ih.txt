 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  ChiPACC Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  serious illnesses and health conditions that are potentially life-threatening place significant stress on both the child and family;  (2)  palliative care relieves children’s symptoms such as pain, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, and sleep problems, and may be provided at any age or stage of serious illness, and has been shown to enhance the quality of life for both the child and family;  (3)  many critical barriers to end-of-life care for children exist under the current health care system, including the limitation of hospice care under the Medicaid program to children expected to live six months or less, a prognosis that medical professionals and families are reluctant to make;  (4) the Children’s Program of All-inclusive Coordinated Care (referred to in this Act as  ChiPACC ) provides all-inclusive care for children with life-threatening conditions and their families from the time of diagnosis and— (A)  fills a gap in coverage under the Medicaid program of integrated, multi-disciplinary services that are reasonable and necessary for the palliation and management of seriously ill children;  (B)  serves a population that includes children who are not yet hospice eligible; and  (C)  provides greater coordination of palliative and curative services for children throughout the course of their illness or condition, which may begin at the time of diagnosis;  (5) some States have opted to provide services targeted to this population through waivers under subsections (b) and (c) of section 1915 of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396n ), each of which requires the approval of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the initial waiver application and any subsequent renewal of such waiver; (6) since 2005, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has approved home and community-based service waivers under section 1915(c) of such Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396n(c) ) to operate ChiPACC in five States; (7)  in States operating ChiPACC under such a waiver—  (A)  the respective State’s Medicaid program achieved significant cost savings through a reduction in inpatient care and an increase in less expensive outpatient care;  (B)  access to CHIPACC services in such States reduced more costly utilizations of other services; and  (C)  services provided through ChiPACC are less costly to the State’s Medicaid program because ChiPACC facilitates children receiving palliative care at home rather than receiving such services in an inpatient hospital setting; and  (8)  allowing States the option to implement ChiPACC through a State plan amendment would—  (A)  give States the ability to make such program a part of a State’s Medicaid program while avoiding the lengthy waiver process; and  (B)  give States the flexibility to establish and design its program to fit the needs of the respective State.
