 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Advanced Coursework Equity Act .
 2.  Purpose  The purposes of this Act are—  (1)  to expand access to advanced courses and programs at under-resourced elementary and secondary schools;  (2)  to advance equitable enrollment practices, so that all students who are ready to engage in more rigorous coursework can benefit from advanced courses and programs; and  (3)  to equip dramatically more students, especially students from historically underrepresented groups, with the twenty-first century skills needed to succeed in college and a competitive global workforce. 
 3.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Black, Latino, and Native American students, students with disabilities, and students from low-income families are underrepresented in advanced programs and courses.   (2)  While 1 in 10 students in schools in the United States participate in the Advanced Placement (AP) program, just over 1 in 20 low-income, Black, and Native American students participate in Advanced Placement, and fewer than 1 in 50 students with disabilities participate.   (3)  Taking the mathematics course Algebra I in grade 8 is necessary for most students to be on track for enrolling in advanced courses, such as Calculus, in high school; however, Black students are half as likely as White students to take Algebra I in grade 8.  (4)  A low-income student with reading and math achievement levels equal to those of a high-income student is half as likely to receive gifted services as the high-income student. Black students are approximately half as likely as White peers with the same mathematics and reading achievement levels to be referred to gifted services.  (5)  A major barrier for Black and Latino students and students with disabilities to access advanced courses and programs is the over-reliance on subjective criteria, such as the recommendation of teachers and counselors, in the advanced course admittance process. When Denver Public Schools implemented universal screening for gifted and talented programs, Latino students were identified for the program at twice the rate as the year before.   (6)  Just 1 in 12 students in the United States scored in the top 2 proficiency levels on the 2018 PISA math assessment. This is below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average and less than half the rate of South Korea, Japan, and Switzerland.  (7)  Public elementary schools and secondary schools face a $305,000,000,000 budget shortfall due to COVID-19 related tax revenue decreases and new COVID-19 related expenses. As school districts prepare to make drastic cuts to educational programming, access to advanced coursework and programs is in jeopardy for millions of students, especially students from underrepresented groups and students attending under-resourced schools. Additional funding and reforms are needed to maintain and expand access to advanced coursework and programs, especially for marginalized students in communities hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 4.  Definitions  In this Act:  (1)  Terms from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 The terms  early college high school ,  elementary school ,  English learner ,  gifted and talented ,  institution of higher education ,  parent ,  school leader ,  secondary school , and  State educational agency  have the meaning given those terms in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 7801 ).  (2)  Local educational agency The term  local educational agency  has the meaning given the term in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 7801 ), and includes a public charter school that is a local educational agency.  (3)  Open enrollment The term  open enrollment  means an enrollment mechanism through which any student that chooses to enroll in an advanced course or program is allowed to do so, without regard to previous academic performance or test scores. (4)  Subgroup of students The term  subgroup of students  has the meaning given that term in section 1111(c)(2) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 6311(c)(2) ). (5)  Universal enrollment The term  universal enrollment  means an enrollment mechanism through which all students are automatically enrolled in an advanced course or program for a particular subject, without regard to previous academic performance or test scores. A parent may choose to opt out a student from enrolling in one or more advanced courses or programs.  (6)  Universal screening The term  universal screening  means an enrollment mechanism through which all students in a grade are screened for enrollment in advanced courses and programs. Students that are determined to be qualified for advanced courses or programs are automatically enrolled in those courses or programs, unless a parent chooses to opt out a student. The determination of which students are qualified for advanced courses or programs— (A)  shall be made after consideration of not less than 2 objective assessments (except that a student may qualify based on only 1 such assessment)—  (i)  that are combined in a reasoned way that is not biased against any particular subgroup of students;  (ii)  that provide appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities;   (iii) that may be administered not explicitly for the primary purpose of determining enrollment in an advanced course or program (such as through a statewide exam that all students in a grade will take), so long as students with disabilities have equal access to the assessment and are provided appropriate accommodations in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1400  et seq.) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( 29 U.S.C. 794 ); and (iv)  that may include—  (I) a standardized assessment that provides appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1400  et seq.) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( 29 U.S.C. 794 );  (II)  a statewide, districtwide, or schoolwide assessment; or  (III)  grades from relevant courses, a portfolio of relevant work, or class ranking; and  (B)  may be partially based upon a subjective measure (such as a teacher’s recommendation) in addition to the required 2 objective measures.
