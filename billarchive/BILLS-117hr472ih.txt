 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  District of Columbia-Maryland Reunion Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the United States Constitution states that the  House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states. .  (2)  The Founding Fathers did not consider the proposed district that would become Washington, DC, a State under the Constitution, as evidenced when Alexander Hamilton offered an amendment to the Constitution during the New York ratification to provide full congressional representation to Washington, DC, but the convention rejected the amendment on July 22, 1788.  (3) Chief Justice Marshall held in Hepburn v. Ellzey in 1805 that the term  states  in Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the Constitution does not include Washington, DC, for representation purposes. (4)  Seven Supreme Court Justices affirmed Chief Justice Marshall’s Hepburn reasoning in National Mut. Ins. Co. of Dist. of Col. v. Tidewater Transfer Co. in 1949.   (5) A Democrat-controlled Congress in 1978 attempted to amend the Constitution to provide Washington, DC, with full congressional representation. The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives reported the resolution and stated that granting congressional representation to the District of Columbia as it is presently constituted would require a constitutional amendment, because  statutory action alone will not suffice . (6)  Amending the Constitution requires two-thirds approval by each house of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the States. In 1978, there was success in obtaining a favorable vote from two-thirds of both the House and the Senate on a constitutional amendment to provide Washington, DC, with full congressional representation, but the requirement for ratification by three-fourths of the States could not be obtained.  (7)  An alternative to a potentially lengthy and difficult constitutional amendment process is ceding Washington, DC, back to Maryland, just as an area of 31 square miles that was originally ceded by Virginia was returned to that State by Federal legislation in 1847, thereby ensuring that the portion of Washington, DC, in Virginia would have Senate and House representation.  (8)   In 1847, there was a desire to allow the District of Columbia land on the west side of the Potomac River that was not being used by the Federal Government to have its own proper representation in Congress.  (9)  Obtaining the desired representation for this portion of Washington, DC, would have required a constitutional amendment unless the land were given back to Virginia.  (10)  Instead of trying to pass a constitutional amendment, Congress in 1847 legislatively ceded back to Virginia from the District of Columbia the non-Federal land composed of 31 square miles on the west side of the Potomac River.  (11)  Accordingly, the District of Columbia would clearly and constitutionally have 2 Senators and a Representative with full voting rights by ceding the District of Columbia to Maryland after Maryland’s acceptance of such retrocession, while maintaining the exclusive legislative authority and control of Congress over the National Capital Service Area in the District of Columbia. 
 3.  Retrocession of District of Columbia to Maryland  (a)  In general  Upon the issuance of a proclamation by the President under section 8 and except as provided in subsection (b), the territory ceded to Congress by the State of Maryland to serve as the District constituting the permanent seat of the Government of the United States is ceded and relinquished to the State of Maryland.  (b)  Continuation of Federal control over National Capital Service Area  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the National Capital Service Area described in section 5 shall not be ceded and relinquished to the State of Maryland and shall continue to serve as the permanent seat of the Government of the United States, and Congress shall continue to exercise exclusive legislative authority and control over such Area. 
 4.  Effect on judicial proceedings in District of Columbia  (a)  Continuation of suits  No writ, action, indictment, cause, or proceeding pending in any court of the District of Columbia on the effective date of this Act shall abate as a result of the enactment of this Act, but shall be transferred and shall proceed within such appropriate court of the State of Maryland as established under the laws or constitution of the State of Maryland.  (b)  Appeals  An order or decision of any court of the District of Columbia for which no appeal has been filed as of the effective date of this Act shall be considered an order or decision of a court of the State of Maryland for purposes of appeal from and appellate review of such order or decision in an appropriate court of the State of Maryland. 
 5.  National Capital Service Area Described  (a)  In general  Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e), upon the retrocession under section 3(a), the National Capital Service Area referred to in section 3(b) is comprised of the principal Federal monuments, the White House, the United States Capitol, the United States Supreme Court Building, and the Federal executive, legislative, and judicial office buildings located adjacent to the Mall and the United States Capitol (but shall not include the District Building), and is more particularly described as the territory located within the boundaries described in subsection (b).
