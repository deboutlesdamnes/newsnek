 (A)  citizens of the United States; and    (B)  Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or Alaska Native.  
 (5)  Program The term  Program  means the grant program established under subsection (b).  (6)  Qualifying advanced energy project The term  qualifying advanced energy project  means a project that—
 (A) 
 (i)  re-equips, expands, or establishes a manufacturing or recycling facility for the production or recycling, as applicable, of advanced energy property; or   (ii)  re-equips an industrial or manufacturing facility with equipment designed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of that facility substantially below the greenhouse gas emissions under current best practices, as determined by the Secretary, through the installation of— 
 (I)  low- or zero-carbon process heat systems;   (II)  carbon capture, transport, utilization, and storage systems; 
 (III)  technology relating to energy efficiency and reduction in waste from industrial processes; or   (IV)  any other industrial technology that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the Secretary; 
 (B)  has a reasonable expectation of commercial viability, as determined by the Secretary; and   (C)  is located in a covered census tract. 
 (7)  Secretary The term  Secretary  means the Secretary of Energy.   (b)  Establishment  Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a program to award grants to eligible entities to carry out qualifying advanced energy projects. 
 (c)  Applications 
 (1)  In general  Each eligible entity seeking a grant under the Program shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require, including a description of the proposed qualifying advanced energy project to be carried out using the grant.   (2)  Selection criteria   (A)  Projects  In selecting eligible entities to receive grants under the Program, the Secretary shall, with respect to the qualifying advanced energy projects proposed by the eligible entities, give higher priority to projects that— 
 (i)  will provide higher net impact in avoiding or reducing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases;   (ii)  will result in a higher level of domestic job creation (both direct and indirect) during the lifetime of the project; 
 (iii)  will result in a higher level of job creation in the vicinity of the project, particularly with respect to—   (I) low-income communities (as described in  section 45D(e)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); and
 (II)  dislocated workers who were previously employed in manufacturing, coal power plants, or coal mining;   (iv)  have higher potential for technological innovation and commercial deployment; 
 (v)  have a lower levelized cost of—   (I)  generated or stored energy; or 
 (II)  measured reduction in energy consumption or greenhouse gas emission (based on costs of the full supply chain); and   (vi)  have a shorter project time.  
 (B)  Eligible entities  In selecting eligible entities to receive grants under the Program, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible entities that are minority-owned.   (d)  Prevailing wages To be eligible to receive a grant under the Program, an eligible entity shall submit to the Secretary a written assurance that all laborers and mechanics employed by any contractor or subcontractor in the performance of work funded, in whole or in part, by the grant shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on work of a similar character in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor under subchapter IV of  chapter 31  of title 40, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon Act). With respect to the labor standards in this subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall have the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1267; 5 U.S.C.

 (e)  Project completion and location; return of unobligated funds 
 (1)  Completion; return of unobligated funds  An eligible entity that receives a grant under the Program shall be required—   (A)  to complete the qualifying advanced energy project funded by the grant not later than 3 years after the date of receipt of the grant funds; and 
 (B)  to return to the Secretary any grant funds that remain unobligated at the end of that 3-year period.    (2)  Location  If the Secretary determines that an eligible entity awarded a grant under the Program has carried out the applicable qualifying advanced energy project at a location that is materially different from the location specified in the application for the grant, the eligible entity shall be required to return the grant funds to the Secretary. 
 (f)  Technical Assistance 
 (1)  In general  Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance on a selective basis to eligible entities that are seeking a grant under the Program to enhance the impact of the qualifying advanced energy project to be carried out using the grant with respect to the selection criteria described in subsection (c)(2)(A).   (2)  Applications  An eligible entity desiring technical assistance under paragraph (1) shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. 
 (3)  Factors for consideration  In selecting eligible entities for technical assistance under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give higher priority to eligible entities that propose a qualifying advanced energy project that has greater potential for enhancement of the impact of the project with respect to the selection criteria described in subsection (c)(2)(A).
