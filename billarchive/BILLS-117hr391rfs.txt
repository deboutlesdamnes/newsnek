The GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative intended to accelerate partner countries’ measurable capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental.

(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama signed Executive Order No. 13747,  Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats . (5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more than 40 GHSA member countries supported the  Kampala Declaration  to extend the GHSA for an additional 5 years to 2024. (6) In December 2017, President Trump released the National Security Strategy, which includes the priority action:  Detect and contain biothreats at their source: We will work with other countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage other countries to invest in basic health care systems and to strengthen global health security across the intersection of human and animal health to prevent infectious disease outbreaks . (7) In September 2018, President Trump released the National Biodefense Strategy, which includes objectives to  strengthen global health security capacities to prevent local bioincidents from becoming epidemics , and  strengthen international preparedness to support international response and recovery capabilities . (8)  In January 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 13987 (86 Fed.
