
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Making Obligations Right by Enlarging Payments In Lieu of Taxes Act  or the  MORE PILT Act .
  2.  Findings; sense of Congress   (a)  Findings  Congress finds that— 
 (1)  Congress agreed with recommendations of a Federal commission that, if Federal land is to be retained by the Federal Government and not contribute to the tax bases of the units of general local government within the jurisdictions of which the land is located, compensation should be offered to those units of general local government to make up for the presence of nontaxable land within the jurisdictions of those units of general local government;   (2)   (A)  units of general local government rely on the stability of property tax revenues; and  
 (B)  Federal programs that are subject to the annual appropriations process, such as the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, offer far less certainty than property taxes as a form of revenue for units of general local government;   (3)  Federal agencies have determined that payments to units of general local government under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program are far lower than what would be due to units of general local government under tax equivalency; 
 (4)  payments under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program help units of general local government carry out vital services, such as firefighting, police protection, public education, construction of public schools, construction of roads, and search-and-rescue operations; and   (5)  the technology exists to more accurately approximate what the taxable value of land held by the Federal Government would be if that land were taxable by units of general local government. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should—   (1)  determine the amount that payments under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program would be if those payments were equivalent to the tax revenues that units of general local government would otherwise receive for the same land; and  
 (2)  compensate those units of general local government accordingly.

Modeling tool, study, and reports relating to the tax equivalent amount of payments under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program   (a)  Modeling tool   (1)  In general  Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the head of any other Federal agency that the Secretary determines to be appropriate, shall develop and maintain a market analysis tool, mass appraisal tool, or other appropriate modeling tool (or combination of tools), as determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, that— 
 (A)  accounts for—   (i)  reasonable and customary valuation factors; and 
 (ii)  if, in the determination of the Secretary, data are inadequate to calculate a sufficiently precise estimate of the market value of the applicable parcel of entitlement land, assumptions of those factors; and    (B)  calculates, in a timely manner— 
 (i)  the approximate market value of entitlement land; and    (ii)  the approximate tax equivalent amount of payments under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program for that land.  
 (2)  Requirements  The tool shall—   (A)  calculate, in a timely manner, the approximate market value of entitlement land; 
 (B)  enable an employee or agent of the Department of the Interior to manually modify factors relating to the valuation model used by the tool to calculate, in a timely manner, the market value of entitlement land based on new assumptions relating to that land;   (C)  to the maximum extent practicable, provide technical anchors relating to market data— 
 (i)  to ensure the ongoing integrity of the tool; and    (ii)  to ensure that the land values determined by the tool are defensible and based on sound and generally accepted valuation methodologies; 
 (D)  to the maximum extent practicable, assimilate, in a visual interface—   (i)  market data, including the availability of mineral extraction, energy production, water management, timber management, agricultural uses, and recreational uses with respect to the applicable land; and

 (ii)  to estimate changes in that value due to future uses under various scenarios under private ownership; and   (G)  provide a variety of estimates of the value of any entitlement land for which there is no comparable non-Federal land from which to derive the information necessary to accurately calculate the market value of the entitlement land, including an estimate based on the highest and best use of the entitlement land if the entitlement land were privately owned. 
 (b)  Study and reports
