 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Electric Vehicles for Underserved Communities Act of 2021 . 
 2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  The transportation sector is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.  (2)  The transportation sector is also a major source of air pollution in the United States, including over 55 percent of total nitrogen oxide emissions, leading to poor air quality and negative health impacts, particularly in urban areas.   (3)  Increasing the deployment of electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging infrastructure is an essential component of combating climate change, decarbonizing the economy, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and health-harming air pollution in the United States.  (4)  Industries relating to electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and the larger clean energy economy are substantial and diverse sources of good jobs and significant contributors to economic growth.  (5)  A substantial increase in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including publicly accessible charging stations, will ensure that our communities are ready to meet the demands of expected electric vehicle adoption as we decarbonize our economy.   (6)  Low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribal communities bear disproportionate climate change and pollution burdens, yet have historically received the least investment in clean technologies and resilient infrastructure. Therefore, such communities must be among the first to receive investment relating to new technologies and infrastructure that address the climate crisis and mitigate localized environmental pollution. 
 3.  Expanding access to electric vehicles in underserved and disadvantaged communities  (a)  In general  (1)  Assessment  The Secretary shall conduct an assessment of the state of, challenges to, and opportunities for the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in underserved or disadvantaged communities located throughout the United States.
