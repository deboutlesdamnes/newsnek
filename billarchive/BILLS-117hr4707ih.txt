
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Reforming Disaster Recovery Act .
  2.  Findings  Congress finds that— 
 (1) following a major disaster declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5170 ), the subset of communities that are most impacted and distressed as a result of the disaster face critical social, economic, and environmental obstacles to recovery, including insufficient public and private resources to address disaster-related housing and community development needs for lower income households and distressed communities;  (2)  unmet disaster recovery needs, including housing assistance needs, can be especially widespread among persons with extremely low, low, and moderate incomes; 
 (3)  economic, social, and housing hardships that affect communities before disasters are exacerbated during crises and can delay and complicate long-term recovery, especially after catastrophic major disasters;   (4)  States, units of local government, and Indian Tribes within the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from major disasters benefit from flexibility to design programs that meet local needs, but face inadequate financial, technical, and staffing capacity to plan and carry out sustained recovery, restoration, and mitigation activities; 
 (5)  the speed and effectiveness considerations of long-term recovery from catastrophic major disasters is improved by predictable investments that support disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of housing and infrastructure, and economic revitalization, primarily for the benefit of low- and moderate-income persons;   (6)  undertaking activities that mitigate the effects of future natural disasters and extreme weather and increase the stock of affordable housing, including affordable rental housing, as part of long-term recovery can significantly reduce future fiscal and social costs, especially within high-risk areas, and can help to address outstanding housing and community development needs by creating jobs and providing other economic and social benefits within communities that further promote recovery and resilience; and 
 (7)  the general welfare and security of the nation and the health and living standards of its people require targeted resources to support State and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities in disaster recovery and mitigation through interim and long-term housing and community development activities that primarily benefit persons of low and moderate income.

(2)  Grant awards  Grants shall be awarded under this section to States, units of general local government, and Indian tribes based on capacity and the concentration of damage, as determined by the Secretary, to support the efficient and effective administration of funds. 
 (3)  Section 106 allocations  Grants under this section shall not be considered relevant to the formula allocations made pursuant to section 106.   (4)  Federal register notice   (A)  In general  Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall issue a notice in the Federal Register containing the latest formula allocation methodologies used to determine the total estimate of unmet needs related to housing, economic revitalization, and infrastructure in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a catastrophic major disaster.  
 (B)  Public comment  In the notice issued under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall solicit public comments on—   (i)  the methodologies described in subparagraph (A) and seek alternative methods for formula allocation within a similar total amount of funding;  
 (ii)  the impact of formula methodologies on rural areas and Tribal areas;   (iii)  adjustments to improve targeting to the most serious needs; 
 (iv)  objective criteria for grantee capacity and concentration of damage to inform grantee determinations and minimum allocation thresholds; and    (v)  research and data to inform an additional amount to be provided for mitigation depending on type of disaster, which shall be no more than 30 percent of the total estimate of unmet needs. 
 (5)  Regulations 
 (A)  In general  The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a formula to allocate assistance from the Fund to the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a catastrophic major disaster.    (B)  Formula requirements  The formula established under subparagraph (A) shall— 
 (i)  set forth criteria to determine that a major disaster is catastrophic, which criteria shall consider the presence of a high concentration of damaged housing or businesses that individual, State, Tribal, and local resources could not reasonably be expected to address without additional Federal assistance, or other nationally encompassing data that the Secretary determines are adequate to assess relative impact and distress across geographic areas;   (ii)  include a methodology for identifying most impacted and distressed areas, which shall consider unmet serious needs related to housing, economic revitalization, and infrastructure;  
 (iii)  include an allocation calculation that considers the unmet serious needs resulting from the catastrophic major disaster and an additional amount up to 30 percent for activities to reduce risks of loss resulting from other natural disasters in the most impacted and distressed area, primarily for the benefit of low- and moderate-income persons, with particular focus on activities that reduce repetitive loss of property and critical infrastructure; and   (iv)  establish objective criteria for periodic review and updates to the formula to reflect changes in available science and data. 
 (C)  Minimum allocation threshold  The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a minimum allocation threshold.   (D)  Interim allocation  Until such time that the Secretary issues final regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary shall— 
 (i)  allocate assistance from the Fund using the formula allocation methodology published in accordance with paragraph (4); and    (ii)  include an additional amount for mitigation equal to 15 percent of the total estimate of unmet need. 
 (6)  Allocation of funds 
 (A)  In general  The Secretary shall—   (i)  except as provided in clause (ii), not later than 90 days after the President declares a major disaster, use best available data to determine whether the major disaster is catastrophic and qualifies for assistance under the formula in paragraph (4) or (5), unless data is insufficient to make this determination; and 
 (ii)  if the best available data is insufficient to make the determination required under clause (i) within the 90-day period described in that clause, the Secretary shall determine whether the major disaster qualifies when sufficient data becomes available, but in no case shall the Secretary make the determination later than 120 days after the declaration of the major disaster.   (B)  Announcement of allocation  If amounts are available in the Fund at the time the Secretary determines that the major disaster is catastrophic and qualifies for assistance under the formula in paragraph (4) or (5), the Secretary shall immediately announce an allocation for a grant under this section. 
 (C)  Additional amounts  If additional amounts are appropriated to the Fund after amounts are allocated under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall announce an allocation or additional allocation (if a prior allocation under subparagraph (B) was less than the formula calculation) within 15 days of any such appropriation.   (7)  Preliminary funding   (A)  In general  To speed recovery, the Secretary is authorized to allocate and award preliminary grants from the Fund before making a determination under paragraph (6) if the Secretary projects, based on a preliminary assessment of impact and distress, that a major disaster is catastrophic and would likely qualify for funding under the formula in paragraph (4) or (5).

 (ii)  may include evaluating the interim housing, permanent housing, and supportive service needs of the disaster impacted community, with special attention to vulnerable populations, such as homeless and low- to moderate-income households, to inform the grantee action plan required under subsection (c).
