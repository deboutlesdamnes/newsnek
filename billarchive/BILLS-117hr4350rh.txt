(3)  The specific evidence to be tested—  (A)  was not previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant did not knowingly fail to request DNA testing of that evidence in a prior motion for postconviction DNA testing; or  (B)  was previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant is requesting DNA testing using a new method or technology that is substantially more probative than the prior DNA testing.  (4)  The specific evidence to be tested is in the possession of the Government and has been subject to a chain of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material to the proposed DNA testing.  (5)  The proposed DNA testing is reasonable in scope, uses scientifically sound methods, and is consistent with accepted forensic practices.  (6)  The applicant identifies a theory of defense that—  (A)  is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense presented at trial; and  (B)  would establish the actual innocence of the applicant of the offense referenced in the applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1).  (7)  If the applicant was convicted following a trial, the identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial.

(B)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption against timeliness for any petition not satisfying subparagraph (A) above.

 747.  Sense of Congress on National Warrior Call Day  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) Establishing an annual  National Warrior Call Day  will draw attention to those members of the Armed Forces whose connection to one another is key to our veterans and first responders who may be dangerously disconnected from family, friends, and support systems. (2)  The number of suicides of members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty increased to 377 in 2020, a figure up from 348 the previous year.  (3)  The epidemic of veteran suicide has steadily increased since 2014 with 6,435 veterans taking their own lives in 2018.  (4)  After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicide in 2018 was 27.5 per 100,000 individuals, higher than the rate among all United States adults at 18.3.  (5)  More veterans have died by suicide in the last 10 years than members of the Armed Forces who died from combat in Vietnam.  (6)  Roughly two-thirds of these veterans who take their own lives have had no contact with the Department of Veterans Affairs.  (7)  The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased isolation and disconnection, further exacerbating mental and physical ailments such as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.  (8)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that law enforcement officers and firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, and emergency medical services providers are 1.39 times more likely to die by suicide than members of the general public.  (9)  Invisible wounds linked to an underlying and undiagnosed traumatic brain injury can mirror many mental health conditions, a problem that can be addressed through connections to members of the Armed Forces and veterans who can better identify and address these wounds.  (10)  Urgent research is needed to highlight the connection between traumatic brain injury as a root cause of invisible wounds and suicide by members of the Armed Forces and veterans.  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that Congress—  (1) supports the designation of a  National Warrior Call Day ; (2)  encourages all Americans, especially members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty and veterans, to call up a warrior, have an honest conversation, and connect them with support, understanding that making a warrior call could save a life; and  (3) implores all Americans to recommit themselves to engaging with members of the Armed Forces through  National Warrior Call Day  and constructive efforts that result in solutions and treatment for the invisible scars they carry.

These efforts have provided an accumulated increase of more than $130,000,000,000 in foreign investments between 2016 and 2020 to strengthen trans-Atlantic security, and it is essential that the United States continue to press NATO allies to achieve their Wales Summit pledges and continue to make progress on greater complementary defense investments.   (3)  The behavior of the Russian Government has not improved and has, in many aspects, become increasingly belligerent since the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, with respect to—  (A)  military efforts to disrupt the territorial integrity of sovereign countries in Europe;  (B)  threats against the United States, NATO, and other United States partners;  (C)  intervention in allied democratic processes;  (D)  efforts to disrupt United States alliances, partnerships, and values;  (E)  acts such as assassination and the use of chemical weapons on the territory of other sovereign countries; and  (F)  other high-risk, disruptive efforts.  (4)  Continued commitment to enhancing the United States and allied force posture in Europe is indispensable for efforts to establish and sustain a credible deterrent against Russian aggression and long-term strategic competition by the Russian government. The Secretary of Defense must continue to—  (A)  support the European Deterrence Initiative and other investments in a strengthened United States and allied force posture in Europe;  (B)  support rotational deployments and robust exercises in the European theater;  (C)  complete efforts to establish prepositioned stocks and effective staging infrastructure to maintain credible deterrence against Russian threats;  (D)  invest effectively in multi-service, cyber, information, and air defense efforts to counter modern military challenges, enhance the survivability and flexibility of the United States force posture, logistics, and planning; and  (E)  consider whether additional forward-positioned forces in Europe would reduce cost and strain, enhance credibility, and strengthen capabilities. 
 1303.  Sense of Congress on security assistance to the Baltic countries  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) The United States has cumulatively allocated over $498,965,000 in Department of Defense partner capacity funding for the Baltic countries since fiscal year 2018, including over $219,000,000 for the Baltic security efforts known as the  Baltic Security Initiative , executed using sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States Code, including assistance with respect to air defense, maritime situational awareness, ammunition, C4ISR, anti-tank capability, special forces, and other defense capabilities. (2)  The Secretary of Defense has completed the comprehensive Baltic Defense Assessment required by section 1246 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 and has recommended continued robust, comprehensive investment Baltic security efforts in accordance with that assessment, with assistance executed using such sections 332 and 333.  (3)  The Secretary of Defense has assessed that the authority granted by such sections 332 and 333 affords the most efficient and effective authority to provide this assistance to the Baltic countries, and that attempting to provide the assistance pursuant to alternate authorities would hamper the Department’s ability to deliver assistance and implement the investment program established by the Baltic Defense Assessment.  (b)  Sense of Congress  Congress strongly supports the robust assistance to accomplish United States strategic objectives in accordance with sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States Code, including by providing assistance to the Baltic countries using those sections, funded by the Baltic Security Initiative. It is the sense of Congress that the security of the Baltic region is crucial to the security of the NATO alliance and these efforts are critical to ensure continued deterrence against Russian aggression and bolster allied security.
