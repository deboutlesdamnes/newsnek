 3.  Electric vehicle charging station mapping program  (a)  In general  Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a program to provide grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, eligible entities to carry out activities described in subsection (c)—  (1)  to determine the locations in which electric vehicle charging stations will be needed to meet the needs of electric vehicle drivers during the evaluation period; and   (2)  to help guide future investments for electric vehicle charging stations.  (b)  Application; consideration  (1)  Application  To be eligible to receive a grant under the program, an eligible entity shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.  (2)  Consideration  In awarding grants under the program, the Secretary may take into consideration and give priority to an eligible entity that will carry out activities using grant funds with respect to—  (A)  a rural area; or  (B)  an area where, as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is a low concentration of electric vehicle charging stations at locations open to the public.  (c)  Use of grant  An eligible entity may use a grant received under the program—   (1)  to evaluate, in an area in the United States designated by the eligible entity—  (A)  the locations of electric vehicle owners on the grant date; and  (B)  the potential locations of electric vehicle owners during the evaluation period, based on data such as commuting and travel patterns;  (2)  to evaluate, in the area designated by the eligible entity, estimated commuting and travel patterns of electric vehicles—  (A)  on the grant date; and  (B)  during the evaluation period;   (3)  to estimate, for the area designated by the eligible entity, the quantity of electricity required to serve electric vehicle charging stations—  (A)  on the grant date; and  (B)  during the evaluation period;  (4)  to develop a map identifying concentrations of electric vehicle charging stations to meet the needs of current and future electric vehicle drivers in the area designated by the eligible entity, based on data such as commuting and travel patterns;  (5)  to estimate future needs for electric vehicle charging stations in the area designated by the eligible entity to support the adoption and use of electric vehicles in shared mobility solutions, such as micro-transit and transportation network companies; or  (6)  to develop an analytical model to allow a city, county, or other political subdivision of a State or a local agency to compare and evaluate different adoption and use scenarios for electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations, with the ability to adjust factors to account for locally and regionally specific characteristics.  (d)  Electric vehicle charging station database  Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish and maintain a fully searchable database, which shall be accessible on the website of the Department of Energy, that contains, at a minimum—  (1)  information maintained by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy of the Department of Energy with respect to the locations of electric vehicle charging stations;  (2)  potential locations for electric vehicle charging stations identified by eligible entities through the program; and  (3)  the ability for a user of the database to sort generated electric vehicle charging station results by various characteristics with respect to those electric vehicle charging stations, including—  (A)  location, in terms of the State, city, or other area specified by the user;  (B)  accessibility, in terms whether the station is public or private;  (C)  status, in terms of whether the station is available, planned, or a potential location identified by an eligible entity under the program; and  (D)  charging type, in terms of—  (i)  level 2 charging equipment; or  (ii)  direct current fast charging equipment.
