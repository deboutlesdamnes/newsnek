 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings; Sense of Congress  (a)  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 ( Public Law 99–435 ; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codified in section 41705 of title 49, United States Code (in this section referred to as the  ACAA ), prohibiting disability-based discrimination in air transportation. (2)  Despite the effort, individuals, including veterans, with disabilities continue to experience significant barriers to and with traveling in air transportation, such as—  (A)  damaged assistive devices;  (B)  inaccessible aircraft, lavatories, and communication media;  (C)  delayed assistance;  (D)  treatment of service animals;  (E)  inadequate disability cultural competency; and  (F)  a lack of suitable seating accommodations.  (b)  Sense of congress  The following is the sense of Congress:  (1)  Access for individuals with disabilities in air transportation must move into the 21st century. Otherwise, individuals with disabilities will be left behind and unable to compete in today’s job market or enjoy the opportunities available to other citizens of the United States.  (2)  Aircraft must be designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities and air carriers must acquire aircraft that meet broad accessibility standards.  (3)  The ACAA must be updated to improve access to air transportation for individuals with disabilities. Legislation is necessary for the modernization of standards and requirements that will strengthen accessibility in air transportation, including the accessibility of aircraft.  (4) The Department of Transportation and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (in this section referred to as the  Access Board ) must promulgate regulations to ensure that all passengers with disabilities receive— (A)  prompt and effective boarding, deplaning, and connections between flights;  (B)  accommodations, including nonstandard accommodations, that safely facilitate air travel; and  (C)  better access to airport facilities, including the provision of visually and tactilely accessible announcements and full and equal access to aural communications.  (5)  Legislation is necessary to ensure that individuals with disabilities have adequate remedies available when air carriers violate the ACAA (including regulations prescribed under the ACAA).  (6)  Unlike other civil rights statutes, the ACAA does not contain a private right of action, which is critical to the enforcement of civil rights statutes. Legislation is necessary to correct this anomaly. 
 3.  Definitions  In this Act:  (1)  Access board The term  Access Board  means the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. (2)  Air carrier The term  air carrier  means an air carrier or foreign air carrier (as those terms are defined in section 40102 of title 49, United States Code). (3)  Disability The term  disability  has the meaning given that term in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( 42 U.S.C. 12102 ), including the meaning under that section as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ( Public Law 110–325 ; 122 Stat. 3553). (4)  Secretary The term  Secretary  means the Secretary of Transportation.
