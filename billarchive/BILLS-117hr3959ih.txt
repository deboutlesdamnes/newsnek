 1.  Short title; findings  (a)  Short title This Act may be cited as the  American Renewable Energy Act of 2021 . (b)  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  the Federal renewable electricity standard established by section 610 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (as added by this Act) establishes a market-based policy to create ongoing competition among renewable electricity generators across the United States and provide the greatest quantity of clean electricity for the lowest price; and  (2)  the United States has vast wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal resources that—  (A)  are renewable;  (B)  are dispersed widely across different regions of the United States;   (C)  can be harnessed to generate a significant share of electricity in the United States; and  (D)  when deployed, will significantly reduce and eliminate the emission of harmful greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants, which have historically been concentrated in underserved communities and communities of color, contributing to disproportionate burdens and environmental injustices.
