Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  the ability of the United States to attract foreign direct investment is directly linked to the long-term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and security of the United States;  (2)  it is a top national priority to enhance the global competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States by—  (A)  removing unnecessary barriers to foreign direct investment and the jobs that such investment creates throughout the United States;  (B)  promoting policies to ensure the United States remains the premier global destination to invest, hire, innovate, provide services and manufacture products; and  (C)  promoting policies to ensure the United States remains the global leader in developing and deploying cutting-edge technologies such as self-driving vehicle technology, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, quantum computing, blockchain, and the like;  (3)  maintaining the United States commitment to open investment policy encourages other countries to reciprocate and enables the United States to open new markets abroad for United States companies and their products;  (4)  while foreign direct investment can enhance the United States economic strength, policies regarding foreign direct investment should reflect national security interests and should not disadvantage domestic investors or companies;  (5)  United States efforts to attract foreign direct investment should be consistent with efforts to maintain and improve the domestic standard of living; and  (6)  as digital information becomes increasingly important to the United States economy and the development of new technologies and services that will be crucial to the country’s competitiveness in the 21st century global economy, barriers such as data localism and infringement of intellectual property rights must be addressed.
