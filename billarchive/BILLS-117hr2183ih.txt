 (4)  High cost area The term  high cost area  means an unserved area in which the cost of building out broadband service is higher, as compared with the average such cost in the United States (and as determined by the Commission), because of—  (A)  the remote location of the area; 
 (B)  the population density of the area;   (C)  the unique topography of the area; 
 (D)  a high rate of poverty in the area; or   (E)  any other factor that contributes to the cost of building out that service. 
 (5)  Location The term  location  has the meaning given the term by the Commission under rules and guidance that are in effect, as of the date of enactment of this section.  (6)  Project The term  project  means an undertaking by a broadband funding partner under this section to construct and deploy infrastructure for the provision of broadband service.
 (7)  Unserved area The term  unserved area  means an area that—  (A)  is of a standard size, as established by the Commission; and
