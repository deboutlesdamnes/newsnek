(c)  Appropriate congressional committees defined In this section, the term  appropriate congressional committees  means— (1)  the congressional intelligence committees; and  (2)  the congressional defense committees (as defined in section 101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code). 
 407.  National Space Intelligence Center  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Section 9081 of title 10, United States Code, establishes the United States Space Force as an Armed Force within the Department of the Air Force to, as stated in subsection (c) of such section—  (A)  provide freedom of operation for the United States in, from, and to space;  (B)  conduct space operations; and  (C)  protect the interests of the United States in space.  (2)  The National Air and Space Intelligence Center, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the primary source for foreign air and space threat analysis within the intelligence enterprise of the Air Force.  (3) Section 8041 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of  Public Law 116–93 ; 133 Stat. 2345) prohibits the establishment of a new field operating agency using funds made available under that Act, although the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a military department may waive the prohibition in cases where the relevant Secretary determines that the establishment will reduce the personnel or financial requirements of the relevant department. (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  space has become increasingly contested, congested, and competitive, mandating an expanded need for space intelligence;  (2)  to support this increasingly complex operational environment, the Space Force should have its own intelligence organization dedicated to providing the Joint Combat forces with the required intelligence and analysis to support operations;  (3)  the co-location of the National Space Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has provided an operational and geographic synergy which greatly benefits combat operations across the air and space operational environments, and maintaining mission synergy across these domains must factor prominently in the basing decision;  (4)  the Air Force has requested authority to establish the National Space Intelligence Center as a field operating agency to ensure the appropriate prioritization of analytic effort for the space domain, enhance responsiveness to national-level customers, and align command relationships with the Director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance of the Space Force; and  (5)  establishing the National Space Intelligence Center as a field operating agency would be a resource-neutral administrative realignment of billets, and would facilitate a lean and agile space intelligence enterprise.  (c)  Exception Notwithstanding section 8041 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of  Public Law 116–93 ; 133 Stat. 2345), or any other provision of law prohibiting the establishment of a field operating agency, the Secretary of the Air Force may establish the National Space Intelligence Center as a field operating agency of the Space Force to perform the analysis and production of scientific and technical intelligence on foreign space and counter-space threat capabilities in the support of the Space Force.
