
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  American Critical Mineral Independence Act of 2021 .
  2.  Findings; sense of Congress   (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1)  The assured supply of critical minerals and the resiliency of critical mineral supply chains are essential to the economic prosperity and national defense of the United States.   (2)  The United States is heavily dependent on foreign sources of critical minerals and on foreign supply chains resulting in the potential for strategic vulnerabilities to both the economy and the military. 
 (3)  As deployment of clean energy technologies and emissions control devices increase, the demand for critical minerals will grow significantly.   (4)  The United States is import-reliant for 30 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior and relies completely on imports to meet demand for 13 of these minerals. 
 (5)  Over the past two decades China has produced more than 80 percent of the world’s rare-earth elements and processed chemicals and has had similar supply control over other critical minerals.   (6)  China's projected total metals demand growth rate suggests that within a decade China's total annual metals demand will increase from today's 55% to more than 75% of the total world production of all metals. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that to break from China’s control on the mineral supply chain, the United States should support significant research and development activities to drive innovation in domestic critical minerals production, promote responsible development of critical minerals, and encourage international collaboration to limit the impact of mineral supply disruptions.
