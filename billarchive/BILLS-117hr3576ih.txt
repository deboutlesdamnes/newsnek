 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Reproductive Rights are Human Rights Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) The United States has joined the international community in identifying reproductive rights as human rights, including in connection with the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women, and through its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966 (referred to in this Act as  ICCPR ), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, done at New York December 21, 1965, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984. (2)  General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the ICCPR, which was adopted by the Human Rights Committee on October 30, 2018, asserts that States parties—  (A) should ensure access for all persons to  quality and evidence-based information and education about sexual and reproductive health and to a wide range of affordable contraceptive methods ; (B)  must provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion where the life and health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, or where carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or suffering, most notably where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or is not viable ;  (C)  ensure the availability of, and effective access to, quality prenatal and post-abortion health care for women and girls ; and (D)  must not impose restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion in a manner that jeopardizes their lives, subjects them to physical or mental pain or suffering, discriminates against them, arbitrarily interferes with their privacy, or places them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions.  (3)  Reproductive coercion, which is any behavior that interferes with autonomous decision making about reproductive health outcomes, is a violation of human rights.  (4)  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons (LGBTQI+) face stigma and discrimination in accessing reproductive health services, and barriers, including anti-LGBTQI+ laws, policies, and gender norms in countries. The denial of access to sexual and reproductive health care and associated human rights violations due to these barriers should be reported in relevant Department of State Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.  (5)  Human rights are grounded in international standards. The Department of State’s deletion of the reproductive rights subsection from its 2017, 2018, and 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices inappropriately politicized human rights of people around the world.  (6)  Limiting reproductive rights also limits pathways to economic, social, and political empowerment. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential for sustainable economic development, are intrinsically linked to gender equality and women’s well-being, and are critical to community health.  (7)  The global COVID–19 pandemic has placed at risk the fulfillment of reproductive rights. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has raised concerns that overloaded health systems, shortages of medical supplies, and disruptions of global supply chains have undermined the sexual and reproductive health and rights of individuals.
