 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Prosecuting Gun Crimes Saves Lives Act .
 2.  Findings  The Congress finds as follows:  (1)  Promoting public safety, addressing gun-based homicides, and enforcing Federal firearms laws are among the highest priorities of the Congress.  (2)  Point-of-sale background checks can reduce the risk of gun-based homicides by preventing criminals and prohibited persons from purchasing firearms while protecting access for law-abiding citizens.  (3)  Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, categories of persons who may pose a threat to public safety, including violent felons, fugitives from justice, and persons convicted of domestic violence crimes, are prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition.  (4)  Thousands of prohibited persons illegally attempt to purchase firearms every year. In 2017, the FBI’s NICS Section referred 112,090 denied transactions to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Of these NICS denials, only 12, or 0.09 percent, were prosecuted in 2017.  (5) On March 12, 2018, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo directing Department of Justice prosecutors to prioritize  vigorous and appropriate  prosecution of cases involving false statements on Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Form 4473. The memo stated that  Criminals and other prohibited persons who attempt to thwart the background check process by lying on the required forms threaten to undermine this important crime prevention tool  and that  we must vigilantly protect the integrity of the background system through appropriate prosecution of those who attempt to circumvent the law . The Department of Justice’s efforts to reclaim the integrity of the background check system yielded a 23-percent increase in the number of defendants charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in the 3 months following issuance of the memo. (6)  On November 13, 2019, Attorney General William Barr announced the launch of a new initiative, Project Guardian, to reduce gun-based homicides by investigating, prosecuting, and preventing firearm crimes. Project Guardian will address gun-based homicides by encouraging coordinated prosecution efforts, enforcement of the background check system, improved information-sharing, response to mental health denials, and crime gun intelligence coordination.  (7)  Congress must ensure Federal, State, and local entities tasked with preventing prohibited individuals from purchasing firearms, recovering firearms from prohibited individuals, and investigating and prosecuting lying and buying and lying and trying cases have sufficient information and resources to carry out their missions and promote public safety.  (8)  Congress urges the Attorney General to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of Federal firearm offenses to protect Americans and prevent and deter the illegal purchase and possession of firearms. 
 3.  Information-sharing with State fusion centers  Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General may direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to regularly provide to State and local law enforcement agencies, including through State law enforcement fusion centers (as defined in section 210A(j)(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002) a report listing individuals for whom the National Instant Criminal Background Check System has issued firearm transfer denials, including the basis for the denial, with the purpose of equipping law enforcement with the information they need to prevent persons from illegally purchasing, receiving, or possessing firearms.
