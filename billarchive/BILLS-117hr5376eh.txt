(2)  Waiver of certain overpayments  In any case in which more than the correct amount of payment for comprehensive paid leave benefits under section 2202 has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery from, any individual who was without fault in connection with the overpayment if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this title or would impede efficient or effective administration of this title, or if such individual relied on the receipt or expected payment of comprehensive paid leave benefits under section 2202 to make a financial decision.
