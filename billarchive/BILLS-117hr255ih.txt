 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Repeal of the Authorization for Use of Military Force .
 2.  Congressional finding Congress finds that the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( Public Law 107–40 ;  50 U.S.C. 1541  note), signed into law on September 18, 2001, has been used to justify a broad and open-ended authorization for the use of military force and such an interpretation is inconsistent with the authority of Congress to declare war and make all laws for executing powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States.
 3. Repeal of  Public Law 107–40 Effective 240 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( Public Law 107–40 ;  50 U.S.C. 1541  note) is hereby repealed.
