Findings; sense of Congress  (a)  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  the Federal Government serves the people of the United States and should seek to continually improve public services provided by the Federal Government based on customer feedback;  (2)  the people of the United States deserve a Federal Government that provides efficient, effective, equitable, and high-quality services and customer experiences across multiple channels;  (3)  many agencies, offices, programs, and Federal employees provide excellent customer experiences to individuals, but many parts of the Federal Government still fall short on delivering the customer experience that individuals have come to expect from the private sector;  (4)  according to the 2020 American Customer Satisfaction Index, the Federal Government ranks among the bottom of all industries in the United States in customer satisfaction;  (5)  providing an equitable, reliable, transparent, and responsive customer experience to individuals improves the confidence of the people of the United States in their Government and helps agencies achieve greater impact and fulfill their missions; and  (6)  improving service to individuals requires agencies to work across organizational boundaries, leverage technology, collect and share standardized data, and develop customer-centered mindsets and experience strategies.  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  all agencies should strive to provide a high-quality, courteous, effective, and efficient customer experience to the people of the United States and seek to measure, collect, report, and use metrics relating to the experience of individuals interacting with agencies to continually improve the customer experience of the people of the United States; and  (2)  adequate Federal funding is needed to ensure agency staffing levels that can provide the public with an improved customer experience.
