Congressional findings and sense of Congress for improved architectural design in government housing programs Section 4 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 ( 12 U.S.C. 1701v ) is amended to read as follows:   4.  Improved architectural design in government housing programs   (a)  Findings  Congress finds that— 
 (1)  if Federal aid is to make its full community-wide contribution toward improving our urban and rural environments, Federal aid must have a greater impact on improvements in architectural design; and   (2)  even within the necessary budget limitations on housing for low- and moderate-income families, architectural design and environmental performance can be improved not only to make the housing more livable, but also to better suit the needs of occupants including human and environmental health, zero carbon emissions, well-being, accessibility, and equity. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that in the administration of housing programs that assist in the provision of housing for low- and moderate-income families, emphasis should be given to—   (1) encouraging good architectural design that yields maximal environmental performance and adheres to accessibility guidelines established in accordance with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ( 42 U.S.C. 12101  et seq.) as an essential component of such housing; and
 (2)  developing, with opportunities for resident involvement, housing that will be of such quality as to reflect the highest international architectural standards and the architectural standards of the neighborhood and the community in which it is situated, consistent with prudent budgeting. 
 .
