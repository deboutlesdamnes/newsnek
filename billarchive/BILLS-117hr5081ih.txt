 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Bayard Rustin was born on March 17, 1912, and was raised by his grandparents in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

(2)  Rustin attended City College of New York, where he joined a progressive club that aimed to remedy racial issues during turbulent times. His time with the club was short lived, but it inspired him to join the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an organization that became a champion for labor rights, equality, and world peace.  (3) His time with the Fellowship of Reconciliation prompted Rustin to become a leader in the 1947  Journey to Reconciliation , an event where White and Black people across the South rode buses together to challenge segregation laws, a precursor to the Freedom Rides. (4)  Rustin was an advisor in Martin Luther King, Jr.’s inner circle as he advocated pacifism and nonviolence for achieving equal treatment for African Americans.  (5)  Rustin used his brilliant strategic handling of the use of aggressive, peaceful action in the civil rights movement and throughout his life as an activist.  (6)  His most important role was as the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, DC, the largest demonstration ever organized at the time, in which a quarter of a million people turned out to demand civil rights for African Americans.  (7)  In the years after the civil rights movement, Rustin used his background as a gay man to inspire others to advocate for and to achieve LGBT rights.  (8)  Rustin remained a strategist and public speaker for workers’ rights movements, including co-founding the A. Philip Randolph Institute for Black trade union members.  (9)  Rustin committed to promoting social good and advocating for the disenfranchised until his death in 1987.
