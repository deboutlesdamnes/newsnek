 2.  Statement of findings and purpose  Congress finds the following:  (1)  The prevalence of occupational licensing has increased dramatically in recent decades, in part because private interests have sought licensing in order to limit competition.  (2)  Occupational licensing often limits opportunities for workers, frustrates entrepreneurs seeking to introduce new business models, and raises prices paid by consumers.  (3)  Licensing should be imposed only to combat real, substantial threats to public health, safety, or welfare and only where other less restrictive regulatory alternatives are insufficient to protect consumers and serve the public interest.  (4)  Regulators should consider a range of less restrictive alternatives before enacting an occupational licensing regime, which may include inspections, bonding or insurance requirements, registration, and voluntary certification.  (5)  Voluntary certification provides a particularly significant alternative to licensure, as it allows market participants to signal to consumers the attainment of personal qualifications without limiting entry into the marketplace.  (6)  The failure of State governments to adopt less restrictive alternatives to licensing, and less burdensome requirements in those areas where licensing is deemed necessary, has resulted in significant costs to consumers and the broader economy.  (7)  The United States Supreme Court responded to these concerns in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. FTC, 135 S. Ct. 1101 (2015), holding that self-interested licensing boards may be subject to liability under the antitrust laws, but that decision has also created significant uncertainty for the States and their licensing boards.  (8)  Some States have responded to the decision in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners by establishing a layer of bureaucratic oversight that merely monitors board actions for consistency with State licensing laws. This response is a missed opportunity for reform, as it does not address the specific competition concern raised in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners or the underlying problems with over-reliance on occupational licensure as a regulatory approach and with overly broad enforcement of licensing laws as a means to regulate commercial activities outside an occupation’s scope of practice.  (9)  Legislation is necessary to clarify the requirements of active supervision, both to offer States a clear and certain mechanism to immunize their occupational boards and to make clear that mere bureaucratic oversight to ensure consistency with State licensing laws does not suffice to confer immunity.  (10)  This Act is intended to offer States a choice between two alternative routes to achieve immunity for their occupational licensing boards—either establishing a mechanism for meaningful active supervision of licensing boards by State officials or establishing a mechanism for meaningful judicial review of board actions in the State courts.

(C)  Review  The State shall establish a mechanism for review of a determination made by the Office under subparagraph (B), under which a complainant may appeal the determination to the general division of the trial court of the State if the challenged occupational regulation would substantially burden the complainant’s ability to—  (i)  engage in a lawful occupation; or  (ii)  employ or contract other individuals for the performance of a lawful occupation.  (4)  Right to raise defense  (A)  In general  The State shall authorize an individual to assert as a defense, in any administrative or judicial proceeding to enforce an occupational regulation, that the regulation does not comply with the policy adopted under subsection (b).

Judicial review  (a)  In general  The immunity under section 4(a) shall apply to any action of an occupational licensing board of a State, or any action of a member, officer, or employee of that board acting in the official capacity of that member, officer, or employee, if—  (1)  the actions of the occupational licensing board or member, officer, or employee are authorized by a non-frivolous interpretation of the occupational licensing laws of the State;  (2)  the State adopts a policy of using less restrictive alternatives to occupational licensing to address real, substantial threats to public health, safety, or welfare, in accordance with section 5(b); and  (3)  the State enacts legislation providing for judicial review of occupational licensing laws, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.  (b)  Judicial review legislation  Legislation enacted by a State under subsection (a)(3)—  (1)  shall—  (A)  prohibit the State and any occupational licensing board from imposing an occupational licensing law unless the State—  (i)  identifies an important government interest in protecting against real, substantial threats to public health, safety, or welfare; and  (ii)  demonstrates that the occupational licensing law is substantially related to achievement of the important government interest described in clause (i), in light of the availability of less restrictive alternatives to occupational licensing;  (B)  provide an affirmative defense against enforcement of any occupational licensing law of the State under which the State shall be required to demonstrate that the standard under subparagraph (A) has been met;  (C)  establish a cause of action under which—  (i)  a person may bring an action for injunctive relief against enforcement of an occupational licensing law of the State;  (ii)  the plaintiff bears the initial burden to prove that the challenged occupational licensing law substantially burdens the plaintiff’s ability to engage in a lawful occupation; and  (iii)  once the plaintiff makes the initial showing under clause (ii), the State is required to demonstrate that the standard under subparagraph (A) has been met;  (D)  provide for an award of reasonable costs and attorney fees to a person who successfully challenges the application of an occupational licensing law of the State by—  (i)  raising an affirmative defense under subparagraph (B); or  (ii)  bringing an action under subparagraph (C); and  (E)  provide for independent judicial review of the occupational licensing laws of the State to ensure that the standard set forth in subparagraph (A) has been met; and  (2)  may not authorize a court to—  (A)  uphold enforcement of an occupational licensing law of the State simply because the court believes the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose;  (B)  rely on hypothetical risks to public safety, not substantiated by evidence in the record, to uphold enforcement of an occupational licensing law of the State;  (C)  defer to factual or legal conclusions of another person or entity, rather than exercising independent review; or  (D)  rely on a post hoc justification for the action of an occupational licensing board that was not put forward by the board at the time of the challenged action.  (c)  Rule of construction  Nothing in subsection (b) shall be construed to require legislation enacted by a State under subsection (a)(3) to provide a right to recover monetary damages, other than reasonable costs and attorney fees as provided under subsection (b)(1)(D).
