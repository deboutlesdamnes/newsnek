 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  United States-Mexico Tourism Improvement Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  The United States and Mexico have benefitted economically from a bilateral, mutually beneficial partnership focused on enhancing the tourism industry in both countries.  (2)  In 2016, Mexican tourism to the United States peaked at 18,990,585 visitors, constituting 1 in 4 (24.9 percent) of all tourists that year.  (3)  Additionally, in 2016, spending by Mexican tourists in the United States totaled $17.5 billion, which represented a 0.7 percent growth from 2015.  (4)  Tourist activity to the United States from Mexico has declined since 2016, which is in contrast to an overall international tourism industry increase in the United States.  (5)  In 2019, international tourist arrivals totaled 79,300,000, up 3.8 percent from 76,400,000 in 2016.  (6)  However, also in 2019, there was a 3.5-percent decline in visitors to the United States from Mexico compared to 2016, comprising a loss of 662,404 Mexican tourists.  (7)  In addition, the total spending from Mexican tourists has plateaued, only increasing slightly from $17.5 billion in 2016 to $17.6 billion in 2019, comprising an increase of $72 million, or 0.4 percent.  (8)  This is a critical economic trend given that annually Mexico is the biggest source of international visitors to the United States after Canada. 
 3.  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States—  (1)  to continue deepening bilateral tourism through governmental cooperation between the United States and Mexico;  (2)  to improve third-party tourism to the United States and Mexico through joint international promotional efforts; and  (3)  to seek to prioritize and expand the tourism industries in both countries by emphasizing exchanges in various international economic sectors, including relating to—  (A)  hospitality and accommodation;  (B)  retail; and  (C)  cultural education. 
 4.
