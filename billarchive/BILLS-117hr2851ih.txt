  2.  Resident-controlled housing demonstration program   (a)  Purpose  The purposes of this section are— 
 (1)  to establish a demonstration program to evaluate the effectiveness of assisting nonprofit organizations, that may have nonprofit, for-profit, government, or intergovernmental partners, to acquire, rehabilitate, construct, convert, or preserve limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations, including manufactured home communities, as affordable housing that is governed by a majority of the residents of such housing;   (2)  to provide alternative homeownership opportunities to those in the private market, which increase access to homeownership for households at lower income levels; 
 (3)  to prevent displacement of existing residents through converting to limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations or through preserving existing limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations;   (4)  to create or preserve mixed-income housing corporations to advance economic and racial diversity and inclusion; and 
 (5)  to evaluate the efficacy and promote the expansion of limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations throughout the Nation that are stewarded and monitored by nonprofit organizations to ensure compliance, sustainability of corporations, resident governance, and that the affordability of the resident-controlled housing lasts over time to serve current and future income-eligible households.   (b)  Eligible entities   (1)  In general  Eligibility to participate in the program under this section and for financial assistance under such program shall be limited to only nonprofit organizations that— 
 (A)  have such experience as the Secretary shall require in developing, preserving, managing, financing, or monitoring limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations; and   (B)  have submitted to the Secretary such information and assurances as the Secretary shall require to ensure that the organization will comply with the purposes and requirements of this section and will use assistance to address the local needs of communities. 
 (2)  Partnerships  Eligible entities may partner with, and seek consultation from, for-profit, nonprofit, public, or quasi-governmental entities on projects under the program.   (c)  Financial assistance   (1)  Mortgage insurance Under the program under this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may insure, pursuant to section 213, 223(f), or 232 of the National Housing Act ( 12 U.S.C. 1715e , 1715n(f), 1715w), a mortgage for the development, acquisition, rehabilitation, or preservation of eligible housing held by an eligible entity, except that the Secretary may for purposes of the demonstration program under this section waive, or specify alternative requirements for, any provision of any statute or regulation that the Secretary administers in connection with the mortgage insurance programs under such sections if the Secretary determines that such waiver or alternative requirement advances the demonstration program.
 (2)  Grants  Under the program under this section, the Secretary may provide a grant to an eligible entity participating in the program for use for the following purposes:   (A)  Pre-development and other costs  For up-front and pre-development costs, including fees and expenses to obtain financing, or for other costs during development, such as capital required before shares to residents are sold. 
 (B)  Steward monitoring fee reserve  For pre-funding a monitoring fee reserve under the program that is paid by the limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations to the nonprofit organization to fund costs of compliance monitoring, which shall be held in reserve in an amount sufficient to cover at least three years of such monitoring costs.   (C)  Technical assistance  For nonprofit organizations to provide technical assistance and training to— 
 (i)  nonprofit organizations developing the capacity to develop, convert, or preserve limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations; and    (ii)  limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations that are forming or already established. 
 (D)  Gap funding  For covering gap funding to ensure limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations are affordable to below the targeted income level.   (E)  Intermediary financing  For community development financial institutions that are certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, have demonstrated expertise in financing limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporations, and are qualified to finance, provide training and technical assistance, and ensure compliance with the program under this section, for providing below market-rate loans and recoverable grants to projects under the program. 
 (d)  Applicability of CDBG program requirements 
 (1)  In general Except as provided in paragraph (2), any housing developed, acquired, converted, or preserve with assistance under subsection (c) shall comply with the requirements applicable under the community development block grant program under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 ( 42 U.S.C. 5301  et seq.) to housing that is assisted under such title.  (2)  Waivers  In administering the program under this section, the Secretary may waive, or specify alternative requirements for, any provision of the community development block grant program (except for requirements related to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and the environment), if the Secretary finds that good cause exists for the waiver or alternative requirement and such waiver or alternative requirement would not be inconsistent with the overall purpose of this section. 
 (e)  Governance  Except in cases of noncompliance with any requirements under the demonstration program under this section, any housing developed, acquired, constructed, or preserved with assistance under subsection (c) shall be governed by a board of directors elected by the members of the limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled corporation with voting structured equitably among all members and as the eligible entity shall establish.    (f)  Role of eligible entity  During a period not shorter than 30 years that begins upon initial occupancy of any housing developed, acquired, constructed, converted, or preserved under the program under this section, the eligible entity that developed, acquired, constructed, or preserved such housing, or its consulting partner, shall take such actions as the Secretary shall require—
