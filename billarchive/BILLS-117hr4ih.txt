(b)  Vote dilution Section 2(b) of such Act ( 52 U.S.C. 10301(b) ) is amended— (1) by inserting after  A violation of subsection (a)  the following:  for vote dilution ; (2) by inserting after the period at the end the following:  For the purposes of this subsection: ; (3)  by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:  (1)  To prevail, a plaintiff shall, as a threshold matter, establish that—  (A)  the members of the protected class are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district;  (B)  the members of the protected class are generally politically aligned; and  (C)  the residents of that district who are not the members of the protected class vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable them to defeat the preferred candidates of the members of the protected class.  (2)  Upon a plaintiff establishing the required threshold showing under paragraph (1), a court shall conduct a totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to a claim of vote dilution to determine whether there was a violation of subsection (a), which shall include the following factors:  (A)  The extent the history of official voting discrimination in the State or political subdivision.  (B)  The extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is racially polarized.  (C)  The extent to which the State or political subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the members of the protected class, such as unusually large election districts, prohibitions against bullet-voting, and majority vote requirements.  (D)  If there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the protected class have been denied access to that process.  (E)  The extent to which members of the protected class in the State or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.  (F)  Whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals.  (G)  The extent to which members of the protected class have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.  (3)  In conducting a totality of the circumstances analysis under paragraph (2), a court may consider such other factors as the court may determine to be relevant, including—  (A)  whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the protected class; and  (B)  whether the policy underlying the State or political subdivision’s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.   (4)  A class of citizens protected by subsection (a) may include a cohesive coalition of members of different racial or language minority groups.  ; and  (4)  Vote denial or abridgement Section 2 of such Act ( 52 U.S.C. 10301 ), as amended by subsections (a) and (b), is further amended by adding at the end the following: (c)  (1)  A violation of subsection (a) resulting in vote denial or abridgment is established if the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure imposes a discriminatory burden on members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a), in that—  (A)  members of the protected class face greater difficulty in complying with the requirement, considering the totality of the circumstances; and  (B)  the greater difficulty is, at least in part, caused by or linked to social and historical conditions that have produced or produce on the date of such challenge discrimination against members of the protected class.  (2)  The challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure need only be a but-for cause of the discriminatory burden described in paragraph (1) or perpetuate a pre-existing burden.  (3)  (A)  The factors that are relevant to a totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to a claim of vote denial or abridgement pursuant to this subsection include the following:  (i)  The history of official voting-related discrimination in the State or political subdivision.  (ii)  The extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is racially polarized.  (iii)  The extent to which the State or political subdivision has used photographic voter identification requirements, documentary proof of citizenship requirements, documentary proof of residence requirements, or other voting practices or procedures, beyond those required by Federal law, that may impair the ability of members of the minority group to participate fully in the political process.  (iv)  The extent to which minority group members bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.  (v)  The use of overt or subtle racial appeals either in political campaigns or surrounding adoption or maintenance of the challenged practice.  (vi)  The extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction, provided that the fact that the minority group is too small to elect candidates of its choice shall not defeat a claim of vote denial or abridgment.  (vii)  Whether there is a lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of minority group members.  (viii)  Whether the policy underlying the State or political subdivision's use of the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is tenuous.  (ix)  Subject to paragraph (4), such other factors as the court may determine to be relevant.  (B)  The factors described in subparagraph (A), individually and collectively, shall be considered as a means of establishing that a voting practice amplifies the effects of past or present discrimination in violation in subsection (a).   (C)  A plaintiff need not show any particular combination or number of factors to establish a violation of subsection (a).  (4)  The factors that are relevant to a totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to a claim of vote denial or abridgement do not include the following:  (A)  The total number or share of members of a protected class on whom a challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure does not impose a material burden.  (B)  The degree to which the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has a long pedigree or was in widespread use at some earlier date.  (C)  The use of an identical or similar qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure in other States or jurisdictions.  (D)  The availability of other forms of voting unimpacted by the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure to all members of the electorate, including members of the protected class, unless the jurisdiction is simultaneously expanding such other practices to eliminate any disproportionate burden imposed by the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure.  (E)  A prophylactic impact on potential criminal activity by individual voters, if such crimes have not occurred in the jurisdiction in substantial numbers.  (F)  Mere invocation of interests in voter confidence or prevention of fraud.  (d)  (1)  A violation of subsection (a) for the purpose of vote denial or abridgement is established if the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is intended, at least in part, to dilute minority voting strength or to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2).  (2)  Discrimination on account of race, color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2) need only be one purpose of a qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure to demonstrate a violation of subsection (a).  (3)  A qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure intended to dilute minority voting strength or to make it more difficult for minority voters to cast a ballot that will be counted violates this subsection even if an additional purpose of the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is to benefit a particular political party or group.  (4)  The context for the adoption of the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure, including actions by official decisionmakers before the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure, may be relevant to a violation of this subsection.   (5)  Claims under this subsection require proof of a discriminatory impact but do not require proof of a violation pursuant to subsection (b) or (c).  . 
 3.  Retrogression Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ( 52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq. ), as amended by section 2 of this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following: (e)  A violation of subsection (a) is established with respect to any challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure that has not been imposed or applied in an election as of the date of such challenge, if such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has the purpose or will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2), within the meaning of section 5.  .

 5.  Criteria for coverage of States and political subdivisions  (a) Determination of States and Political Subdivisions Subject to Section 4( a ) (1)  In general Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ( 52 U.S.C. 10303(b) ) is amended to read as follows: (b)  Determination of States and Political Subdivisions Subject to Requirements  (1)  Existence of voting rights violations during previous 25 years  (A)  Statewide application  Subsection (a) applies with respect to a State and all political subdivisions within the State during a calendar year if—  (i)  fifteen or more voting rights violations occurred in the State during the previous 25 calendar years;   (ii)  ten or more voting rights violations occurred in the State during the previous 25 calendar years, at least one of which was committed by the State itself (as opposed to a political subdivision within the State); or  (iii)  three or more voting rights violations occurred in the State during the previous 25 calendar years and the State itself administers the elections in the State or political subdivisions in which the voting rights violations occurred.  (B)  Application to specific political subdivisions  Subsection (a) applies with respect to a political subdivision as a separate unit during a calendar year if three or more voting rights violations occurred in the subdivision during the previous 25 calendar years.  (2)  Period of application  (A)  In general  Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if, pursuant to paragraph (1), subsection (a) applies with respect to a State or political subdivision during a calendar year, subsection (a) shall apply with respect to such State or political subdivision for the period—  (i)  that begins on January 1 of the year in which subsection (a) applies; and  (ii)  that ends on the date which is 10 years after the date described in clause (i).  (B)  No further application after declaratory judgment  (i)  States  If a State obtains a declaratory judgment under subsection (a), and the judgment remains in effect, subsection (a) shall no longer apply to such State pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) unless, after the issuance of the declaratory judgment, paragraph (1)(A) applies to the State solely on the basis of voting rights violations occurring after the issuance of the declaratory judgment.  (ii)  Political subdivisions  If a political subdivision obtains a declaratory judgment under subsection (a), and the judgment remains in effect, subsection (a) shall no longer apply to such political subdivision pursuant to paragraph (1), including pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) (relating to the statewide application of subsection (a)), unless, after the issuance of the declaratory judgment, paragraph (1)(B) applies to the political subdivision solely on the basis of voting rights violations occurring after the issuance of the declaratory judgment.  (3)  Determination of voting rights violation  For purposes of paragraph (1), a voting rights violation occurred in a State or political subdivision if any of the following applies:  (A)  Judicial relief; violation of the 14th or 15th Amendment  Any final judgment, or any preliminary, temporary, or declaratory relief (that was not reversed on appeal), in which the plaintiff prevailed or a court of the United States found that the plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or raised a question with regard to race discrimination, in which any court of the United States determined that a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group occurred, or that a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting created an undue burden on the right to vote in connection with a claim that the law unduly burdened voters of a particular race, color, or language minority group, in violation of the 14th or 15th Amendment, anywhere within the State or subdivision.  (B)  Judicial relief; violations of this Act  Any final judgment, or any preliminary, temporary, or declaratory relief (that was not reversed on appeal) in which the plaintiff prevailed or a court of the United States found that the plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or raised a serious question with regard to race discrimination, in which any court of the United States determined that a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting was imposed or applied or would have been imposed or applied anywhere within the State or subdivision in a manner that resulted or would have resulted in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, in violation of subsection 4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, or 203 of this Act.   (C)  Final judgment; Denial of declaratory judgment  In a final judgment (that was not been reversed on appeal), any court of the United States has denied the request of the State or subdivision for a declaratory judgment under section 3(c) or section 5, and thereby prevented a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting from being enforced anywhere within the State or subdivision.  (D)  Objection by the Attorney General  The Attorney General has interposed an objection under section 3(c) or section 5, and thereby prevented a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting from being enforced anywhere within the State or subdivision. A violation per this subsection has not occurred where an objection has been withdrawn by the Attorney General, unless the withdrawal was in response to a change in the law or practice that served as the basis of the objection. A violation under this subsection has not occurred where the objection is based solely on a State or political subdivision’s failure to comply with a procedural process that would not otherwise constitute an independent violation of this act.  (E)  Consent decree, settlement, or other agreement  A consent decree, settlement, or other agreement was adopted or entered by a court of the United States or contained an admission of liability by the defendants, which resulted in the alteration or abandonment of a voting practice anywhere in the territory of such State that was challenged on the ground that the practice denied or abridged the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group in violation of subsection 4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, or 203 of this Act, or the 14th or 15th Amendment. An extension or modification of an agreement as defined by this subsection that has been in place for ten years or longer shall count as an independent violation. If a court of the United States finds that an agreement itself as defined by this subsection denied or abridged the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, violated subsection 4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, or 203 of this Act, or created an undue burden on the right to vote in connection with a claim that the consent decree, settlement, or other agreement unduly burdened voters of a particular race, color, or language minority group, that finding shall count as an independent violation.  (F)  Multiple violations  Each voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting, including each redistricting plan, found to be a violation by a court of the United States pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), or prevented from enforcement pursuant to subsection (c) or (d), or altered or abandoned pursuant to subsection (e) shall count as an independent violation. Within a redistricting plan, each violation found to discriminate against any group of voters based on race, color, or language minority group shall count as an independent violation.   (4)  Timing of determinations  (A)  Determinations of voting rights violations  As early as practicable during each calendar year, the Attorney General shall make the determinations required by this subsection, including updating the list of voting rights violations occurring in each State and political subdivision for the previous calendar year.  (B)  Effective upon publication in Federal Register  A determination or certification of the Attorney General under this section or under section 8 or 13 shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register.  .  (2)  Conforming amendments Section 4(a) of such Act ( 52 U.S.C. 10303(a) ) is amended— (A) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence of the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking  any State with respect to which  and all that follows through  unless  and inserting  any State to which this subsection applies during a calendar year pursuant to determinations made under subsection (b), or in any political subdivision of such State (as such subdivision existed on the date such determinations were made with respect to such State), though such determinations were not made with respect to such subdivision as a separate unit, or in any political subdivision with respect to which this subsection applies during a calendar year pursuant to determinations made with respect to such subdivision as a separate unit under subsection (b), unless ; (B)  in paragraph (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking the second sentence;  (C) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking  (in the case of a State or subdivision seeking a declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this subsection) ; (D) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking  (in the case of a State or subdivision seeking a declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this subsection) ; (E) in paragraph (3), by striking  (in the case of a State or subdivision seeking a declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this subsection) ; (F) in paragraph (5), by striking  (in the case of a State or subdivision which sought a declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this subsection) ; (G)  by striking paragraphs (7) and (8); and  (H)  by redesignating paragraph (9) as paragraph (7).  (b)  Clarification of Treatment of Members of Language Minority Groups Section 4(a)(1) of such Act ( 52 U.S.C. 10303(a)(1) ) is amended by striking  race or color,  and inserting  race, color, or in contravention of the guarantees of subsection (f)(2), .

(B)  Publication in the Federal Register  A determination or certification of the Attorney General under this paragraph shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register.  (b)  Covered practices  To assure that the right of citizens of the United States to vote is not denied or abridged on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group as a result of the implementation of certain qualifications or prerequisites to voting, or standards, practices, or procedures with respect to voting newly adopted in a State or political subdivision, the following shall be covered practices subject to the requirements described in subsection (a):  (1)  Changes to method of election  Any change to the method of election—  (A)  to add seats elected at-large in a State or political subdivision where—  (i)  two or more racial groups or language minority groups each represent 20 percent or more of the political subdivision’s voting-age population; or  (ii)  a single language minority group represents 20 percent or more of the voting-age population on Indian lands located in whole or in part in the political subdivision; or  (B)  to convert one or more seats elected from a single-member district to one or more at-large seats or seats from a multi-member district in a State or political subdivision where—  (i)  two or more racial groups or language minority groups each represent 20 percent or more of the political subdivision’s voting-age population; or  (ii)  a single language minority group represents 20 percent or more of the voting-age population on Indian lands located in whole or in part in the political subdivision.

(3)  Changes through redistricting  Any change to the boundaries of election districts in a State or political subdivision where any racial group or language minority group that is not the largest racial group or language minority group in the jurisdiction and that represents 15 percent or more of the State or political subdivision’s voting-age population experiences a population increase of at least 20 percent of its voting-age population, over the preceding decade (as calculated by the Bureau of the Census under the most recent decennial census), in the jurisdiction.  (4)  Changes in documentation or qualifications to vote  Any change to requirements for documentation or proof of identity to vote or register to vote that will exceed or be more stringent than such requirements under State law on the day before the date of enactment of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021; and further, if a State has in effect a requirement that an individual present identification as a condition of receiving and casting a ballot in an election for Federal office, if the State does not permit the individual to meet the requirement and cast a ballot in the election in the same manner as an individual who presents identification—  (A)  in the case of an individual who desires to vote in person, by presenting the appropriate State or local election official with a sworn written statement, signed by the individual under penalty of perjury, attesting to the individual’s identity and attesting that the individual is eligible to vote in the election; and   (B)  in the case of an individual who desires to vote by mail, by submitting with the ballot the statement described in subparagraph (A).  (5)  Changes to multilingual voting materials  Any change that reduces multilingual voting materials or alters the manner in which such materials are provided or distributed, where no similar reduction or alteration occurs in materials provided in English for such election.

(7)  New list maintenance process  Any change to the maintenance of voter registration lists that adds a new basis for removal from the list of active registered voters or that incorporates new sources of information in determining a voter’s eligibility to vote, wherein such a change would have a statistically significant disparate impact on the removal from voter rolls of members of racial groups or language minority groups that constitute greater than 5 percent of the voting-age population—  (A)  in the case of a political subdivision imposing such change if—  (i)  two or more racial groups or language minority groups each represent 20 percent or more of the voting-age population of the political subdivision; or  (ii)  a single language minority group represents 20 percent or more of the voting-age population on Indian lands located in whole or in part in the political subdivision; or  (B)  in the case of a State imposing such change, if two or more racial groups or language minority groups each represent 20 percent or more of the voting-age population of—  (i)  the State; or  (ii)  a political subdivision in the State, except that the requirements under subsections (a) and (c) shall apply only with respect to each such political subdivision.   (c)  Preclearance  (1)  In general  Whenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the requirements set forth in subsection (a) are in effect shall enact, adopt, or seek to implement any covered practice described under subsection (b), such State or subdivision may institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such covered practice neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, and unless and until the court enters such judgment such covered practice shall not be implemented. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, such covered practice may be implemented without such proceeding if the covered practice has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within 60 days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within 60 days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made. Neither an affirmative indication by the Attorney General that no objection will be made, nor the Attorney General's failure to object, nor a declaratory judgment entered under this section shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin implementation of such covered practice. In the event the Attorney General affirmatively indicates that no objection will be made within the 60-day period following receipt of a submission, the Attorney General may reserve the right to reexamine the submission if additional information comes to the Attorney General's attention during the remainder of the 60-day period which would otherwise require objection in accordance with this section.

(2)  Denying or abridging the right to vote  Any covered practice described in subsection (b) that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this subsection.  (3)  Purpose defined The term  purpose  in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall include any discriminatory purpose. (4)  Purpose of paragraph (2)  The purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice.

Such actions shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges under section 2284 of title 28, United States Code. In any such action, the court shall provide as a remedy that any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting, that is the subject of the action under this subsection be enjoined unless the court determines that—  (1)  the voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting, is not a covered practice described in subsection (b); or  (2)  the State or political subdivision has complied with subsection (c) with respect to the covered practice at issue.

In reviewing an application for a stay or vacatur of equitable relief, findings of fact made in issuing the order under review shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.
