 873a. Art. 73a.  Petition for DNA testing 
 (a)  In general Upon a written petition by an accused sentenced to imprisonment or death pursuant to a conviction under this chapter (referred to in this section as the  applicant ), the Judge Advocate General shall order DNA testing of specific evidence if the Judge Advocate General finds that all of the following apply:  (1)  The applicant asserts, under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is actually innocent of the offense for which the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment or death. 
 (2)  The specific evidence to be tested was secured in relation to the investigation or prosecution of the offense referenced in the applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1).   (3)  The specific evidence to be tested— 
 (A)  was not previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant did not knowingly fail to request DNA testing of that evidence in a prior motion for postconviction DNA testing; or   (B)  was previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant is requesting DNA testing using a new method or technology that is substantially more probative than the prior DNA testing. 
 (4)  The specific evidence to be tested is in the possession of the Government and has been subject to a chain of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material to the proposed DNA testing.   (5)  The proposed DNA testing is reasonable in scope, uses scientifically sound methods, and is consistent with accepted forensic practices. 
 (6)  The applicant identifies a theory of defense that—   (A)  is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense presented at trial; and 
 (B)  would establish the actual innocence of the applicant of the offense referenced in the applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1).   (7)  If the applicant was convicted following a trial, the identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial. 
 (8)  The proposed DNA testing of the specific evidence may produce new material evidence that would—   (A)  support the theory of defense referenced in paragraph (6); and 
 (B)  raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense.   (9)  The applicant certifies that the applicant will provide a DNA sample for purposes of comparison. 
 (10)  The petition is made in a timely fashion, subject to the following conditions:   (A)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption of timeliness if the petition is made within five years of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 or within three years after the date of the entry of judgment under section 860c of this title (article 60c), whichever comes later. Such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing— 
 (i)  that the applicant’s petition for a DNA test is based solely upon information used in a previously denied motion; or   (ii)  of clear and convincing evidence that the applicant’s filing is done solely to cause delay or harass. 
 (B)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption against timeliness for any petition not satisfying subparagraph (A) above. Such presumption may be rebutted upon the Judge Advocate General’s finding—   (i)  that the applicant was or is incompetent and such incompetence substantially contributed to the delay in the applicant’s motion for a DNA test; 
 (ii)  the evidence to be tested is newly discovered DNA evidence;   (iii)  that the applicant’s petition is not based solely upon the applicant’s own assertion of innocence and, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the petition, a denial would result in a manifest injustice; or 
 (iv)  upon good cause shown.   (C)  For purposes of this paragraph— 
 (i) the term  incompetence  has the meaning given that term in section 876b of this chapter (article 76b);  (ii) the term  manifest  means that which is unmistakable, clear, plain, or indisputable and requires that the opposite conclusion be clearly evident.

(c)  Evidence inventory; preservation order; appointment of counsel   (1)  Inventory  The Judge Advocate General shall order the preparation of an inventory of the evidence related to the case for which a petition is made under subsection (a), which shall be provided to the applicant. 
 (2)  Preservation order  To the extent necessary to carry out proceedings under this section, the Judge Advocate General shall direct the preservation of the specific evidence relating to a petition under subsection (a).   (3)  Appointment of counsel  The applicant shall be eligible for representation by appellate defense counsel under section 870 of this chapter (article 70).

 (1)  any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be completed not later than 60 days after the date on which the test is ordered by the Judge Advocate General; and   (2)  not later than 120 days after the date on which the DNA testing ordered under this section is completed, the Judge Advocate General shall order any post-testing procedures under subsection (f) or (g), as appropriate. 
 (f)  Disclosure of test results  Reporting of test results shall be simultaneously disclosed to the Government and the applicant.   (g)  Post-testing procedures; inconclusive and inculpatory results   (1)  Inconclusive results  If DNA test results obtained under this section are inconclusive, the Judge Advocate General may order further testing, if appropriate, or may deny the applicant relief. 
 (2)  Inculpatory results  If DNA test results obtained under this section show that the applicant was the source of the DNA evidence, the Judge Advocate General shall—   (A)  deny the applicant relief; and 
 (B)  if the DNA test results relate to a State offense, forward the finding to any appropriate State official.   (h)  Post-testing procedures; motion for new trial or resentencing   (1)  In general  Notwithstanding any provision of law that would bar a motion under this paragraph as untimely, if DNA test results obtained under this section exclude the applicant as the source of the DNA evidence, the applicant may file a petition for a new trial or resentencing, as appropriate. 
 (2)  Standard for granting motion for new trial or resentencing  The applicant’s petition for a new trial or resentencing, as appropriate, shall be granted if the DNA test results, when considered with all other evidence in the case (regardless of whether such evidence was introduced at trial), establish by compelling evidence that a new trial would result in the acquittal of the applicant.   (i)  Relationship to other laws   (1)  Post-conviction relief  Nothing in this section shall affect the circumstances under which a person may obtain DNA testing or post-conviction relief under any other provision of law. 
 (2)  Habeas corpus  Nothing in this section shall provide a basis for relief in any Federal habeas corpus proceeding.

  577.  Justice for Women Veterans   (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1)  In June 1948, Congress enacted the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, which formally authorized the appointment and enlistment of women in the regular components of the Armed Forces.   (2)  With the expansion of the Armed Forces to include women, the possibility arose for the first time that members of the regular components of the Armed Forces could become pregnant. 
 (3)  The response to such possibilities and actualities was Executive Order 10240, signed by President Harry S. Truman in 1951, which granted the Armed Forces the authority to involuntarily separate or discharge a woman if she became pregnant, gave birth to a child, or became a parent by adoption or a stepparent.   (4)  The Armed Forces responded to the Executive order by systematically discharging any woman in the Armed Forces who became pregnant, regardless of whether the pregnancy was planned, unplanned, or the result of sexual abuse. 
 (5)  Although the Armed Forces were required to offer women who were involuntarily separated or discharged due to pregnancy the opportunity to request retention in the military, many such women were not offered such opportunity.   (6)  The Armed Forces did not provide required separation benefits, counseling, or assistance to the members of the Armed Forces who were separated or discharged due to pregnancy. 
 (7)  Thousands of members of the Armed Forces were involuntarily separated or discharged from the Armed Forces as a result of pregnancy.   (8)  There are reports that the practice of the Armed Forces to systematically separate or discharge pregnant members caused some such members to seek an unsafe or inaccessible abortion, which was not legal at the time, or to put their children up for adoption, and that, in some cases, some women died by suicide following their involuntary separation or discharge from the Armed Forces. 
 (9)  Such involuntary separation or discharge from the Armed Forces on the basis of pregnancy was challenged in Federal district court by Stephanie Crawford in 1975, whose legal argument stated that this practice violated her constitutional right to due process of law.   (10)  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in Stephanie Crawford’s favor in 1976 and found that Executive Order 10240 and any regulations relating to the Armed Forces that made separation or discharge mandatory due to pregnancy were unconstitutional. 
 (11)  By 1976, all regulations that permitted involuntary separation or discharge of a member of the Armed Forces because of pregnancy or any form of parenthood were rescinded.   (12)  Today, women comprise 17 percent of the Armed Forces, and many are parents, including 12 percent of whom are single parents. 
 (13)  While military parents face many hardships, today’s Armed Forces provides various lengths of paid family leave for mothers and fathers. for both birth and adoption of children.   (b)  Sense of Congress   (1)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that women who served in the Armed Forces before February 23, 1976 should not have been involuntarily separated or discharged due to pregnancy or parenthood. 
 (2)  Expression of remorse  Congress hereby expresses deep remorse for the women who patriotically served in the Armed Forces, but were forced, by official United States policy, to endure unnecessary and discriminatory actions, including the violation of their constitutional right to due process of law, simply because they became pregnant or became a parent while a member of the Armed Forces.   (c)  GAO study of women involuntarily separated or discharged due to pregnancy or parenthood   (1)  Study required  The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study regarding women involuntarily separated or discharged from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy or parenthood during the period of 1951 through 1976. The study shall identify— 
 (A)  the number of such women, disaggregated by—   (i)  Armed Force; 
 (ii)  grade;   (iii)  race; and 
 (iv)  ethnicity;   (B)  the characters of such discharges or separations; 
 (C)  discrepancies in uniformity of such discharges or separations;   (D)  how such discharges or separations affected access of such women to health care and benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs; and

 747.  Sense of Congress on National Warrior Call Day 
 (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:   (1) Establishing an annual  National Warrior Call Day  will draw attention to those members of the Armed Forces whose connection to one another is key to our veterans and first responders who may be dangerously disconnected from family, friends, and support systems.
 (2)  The number of suicides of members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty increased to 377 in 2020, a figure up from 348 the previous year.   (3)  The epidemic of veteran suicide has steadily increased since 2014 with 6,435 veterans taking their own lives in 2018. 
 (4)  After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicide in 2018 was 27.5 per 100,000 individuals, higher than the rate among all United States adults at 18.3.   (5)  More veterans have died by suicide in the last 10 years than members of the Armed Forces who died from combat in Vietnam. 
 (6)  Roughly two-thirds of these veterans who take their own lives have had no contact with the Department of Veterans Affairs.   (7)  The COVID–19 pandemic has only increased isolation and disconnection, further exacerbating mental and physical ailments such as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. 
 (8)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that law enforcement officers and firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, and emergency medical services providers are 1.39 times more likely to die by suicide than members of the general public.   (9)  Invisible wounds linked to an underlying and undiagnosed traumatic brain injury can mirror many mental health conditions, a problem that can be addressed through connections to members of the Armed Forces and veterans who can better identify and address these wounds. 
 (10)  Urgent research is needed to highlight the connection between traumatic brain injury as a root cause of invisible wounds and suicide by members of the Armed Forces and veterans.   (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that Congress— 
 (1) supports the designation of a  National Warrior Call Day ;  (2)  encourages all Americans, especially members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty and veterans, to call up a warrior, have an honest conversation, and connect them with support, understanding that making a warrior call could save a life; and 
 (3) implores all Americans to recommit themselves to engaging with members of the Armed Forces through  National Warrior Call Day  and constructive efforts that result in solutions and treatment for the invisible scars they carry.

  1099.  Anomalous Health Incidents Interagency Coordinator   (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1) Since at least 2016, United States Government personnel and their family members have reported anomalous health incidents at diplomatic missions across the world and in the United States, which are sometimes referred to as  Havana Syndrome .  (2)  Some of the anomalous health incidents have resulted in unexplained brain injuries, which have had permanent, life-altering effects that have disrupted lives and ended careers. 
 (3)  A panel of experts convened by the Bureau of Medical Services of the Department of State in July 2017 to review triage assessments of medically evaluated personnel from the United States Embassy in Havana came to a consensus that the findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a nonnatural source.   (4) A 2020 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that  many of the distinctive and acute signs, symptoms, and observations reported by [affected] employees are consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy  and that  directed pulsed RF energy [...] appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases .
 (5) According to the National Academy of Sciences report,  such a scenario raises grave concerns about a world with disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for causing harm to others .  (6)  The number and locations of these suspected attacks have expanded and, according to press reporting, there have been more than 130 possible cases that have been reported by United States personnel in Asia, in Europe, and in the Western Hemisphere, including within the United States. 
 (7)  The continuing and expanding scope of these suspected attacks is impacting the security and morale of United States personnel, especially those posted overseas.   (8)  The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons (including diplomatic agents) to which 180 countries are a party, protects diplomatic personnel from attacks on their persons, accommodations, or means of transport, and requires all state parties to punish and take measures to prevent such grave crimes. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—   (1)  the threat to United States Government personnel from suspected attacks presenting as anomalous health incidents is a matter of urgent concern and deserving of the full attention of government; 
 (2)  personnel, dependents, and other appropriate individuals suffering anomalous health incidents from these suspected attacks deserve equitable, accessible, and high-quality medical assessment and care, regardless of their employing Government agency;   (3)  diagnoses and determinations to treat personnel, dependents, and other appropriate individuals experiencing symptoms consistent with such injuries should be made by experienced medical professionals and made available by the Federal Government; 
 (4)  any recriminations, retaliation, or punishment associated with personnel self-reporting symptoms is unacceptable and should be investigated by internal agency oversight mechanisms;   (5)  information sharing and interagency coordination is essential for the comprehensive investigation, attribution, and mitigation of these injuries; 
 (6)  the Administration should provide Congress and the public with timely and regular unclassified updates on the threat posed to United States Government personnel by the suspected causes of these injuries;   (7)  recent efforts by the Administration and among relevant agencies represent positive steps toward responding to the threat of anomalous health incidents, but more comprehensive measures must be taken to further assist victims, investigate and determine the cause of the injuries of such victims, and prevent future incidents; 
 (8)  establishing the source and cause of these anomalous health incidents must be a top priority for the United States Government and requires the full coordination of relevant agencies;   (9)  if investigations determine that the anomalous health incidents are the result of deliberate acts by individuals, entities, or foreign countries, the United States Government should recognize and respond to these incidents as hostile attacks; and 
 (10)  any actors found to have been targeting United States Government personnel should be publicly identified, as appropriate, and held accountable.   (c)  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States— 
 (1)  to detect, deter, and punish any clandestine attacks that cause persistent injuries to United States personnel;   (2)  to provide appropriate assistance to United States personnel harmed by such attacks; 
 (3)  to hold responsible any persons, entities, or governments involved in ordering or carrying out such attacks, including through appropriate sanctions, criminal prosecutions, or other tools;   (4)  to prioritize research into effective countermeasures to help protect United States personnel from such attacks; and 
 (5)  to convey to foreign governments through official contact at the highest levels the gravity of United States concern about such suspected attacks and the seriousness of consequences that may follow for any actors found to be involved.   (d)  Anomalous Health Incidents Interagency Coordinator   (1)  Designation  Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the President shall designate—

(2) The Genocide Convention entered into force on January 12, 1951, and declares that all state parties  confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish .
 (3) The Genocide Convention defines genocide as  any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group .  (4) The United States ratified the Genocide Convention with the understanding that the commission of genocide requires  the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a [protected] group as such .
 (5)  The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a state party to the Genocide Convention.   (6)  Since 2017, the PRC Government, under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has detained and sought to indoctrinate more than one million Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups. 
 (7)  Recent data indicate a significant drop in birth rates among Uyghurs due to enforced sterilization, enforced abortion, and more onerous birth quotas for Uyghurs compared to Han.   (8)  There are credible reports of PRC Government campaigns to promote marriages between Uyghurs and Han and to reduce birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. 
 (9)  Many Uyghurs reportedly have been assigned to factory employment under conditions that indicate forced labor, and some former detainees have reported food deprivation, beatings, suppression of religious practices, family separation, and sexual abuse.   (10)  This is indicative of a systematic effort to eradicate the ethnic and cultural identity and religious beliefs, and prevent the births of, Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, and members of religious minority groups. 
 (11)  The birth rate in the Xinjiang region fell by 24 percent in 2019 compared to a 4.2 percent decline nationwide.   (12)  On January 19, 2021, the Department of State determined the PRC Government, under the direction and control of the CCP, has committed crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. 
 (13)  Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have both stated that what has taken place in Xinjiang is genocide and constitutes crimes against humanity.   (14) Article VIII of the Genocide Convention provides,  Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide .
 (15) The International Court of Justice has stated that it is the obligation of all state parties to the Genocide Convention to  employ all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible .  (16)  The United States is a Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council. 
 (b)  Statement of Congress  Congress—   (1)  finds that the ongoing abuses against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups constitute genocide as defined in the Genocide Convention and crimes against humanity as understood under customary international law; 
 (2)  attributes these atrocity crimes against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups to the People’s Republic of China, under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party;   (3)  condemns this genocide and these crimes against humanity in the strongest terms; and 
 (4)  calls upon the President to direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to—   (A)  refer the People’s Republic of China’s genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups to the competent organs of the United Nations for investigation; 
 (B)  seize the United Nations Security Council of the circumstances of this genocide and crimes against humanity and lead efforts to invoke multilateral sanctions in response to these ongoing atrocities; and   (C)  take all possible actions to bring this genocide and these crimes against humanity to an end and hold the perpetrators of these atrocities accountable under international law.

 1302.  Sense of Congress on United States defense posture in Europe  It is the sense of Congress as follows:   (1)  The United States is steadfastly committed to upholding and strengthening its defense alliances and partnerships in the European theater. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance is the bedrock of these relationships, which are central to deterring Russian aggression, upholding territorial integrity and sovereignty in Europe, countering malign efforts to undermine the rules-based international order and disrupt shared values, fostering international cooperation against collective challenges, and advancing shared national security objectives worldwide.  
 (2)  United States allies in Europe have made substantial strides on responsibility-sharing and defense investment since the Wales Declaration in 2014 and should be commended for their ongoing efforts to increase complementary investments in NATO deterrence capacity. These efforts have provided an accumulated increase of more than $130,000,000,000 in foreign investments between 2016 and 2020 to strengthen trans-Atlantic security, and it is essential that the United States continue to press NATO allies to achieve their Wales Summit pledges and continue to make progress on greater complementary defense investments.    (3)  The behavior of the Russian Government has not improved and has, in many aspects, become increasingly belligerent since the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, with respect to— 
 (A)  military efforts to disrupt the territorial integrity of sovereign countries in Europe;   (B)  threats against the United States, NATO, and other United States partners; 
 (C)  intervention in allied democratic processes;   (D)  efforts to disrupt United States alliances, partnerships, and values; 
 (E)  acts such as assassination and the use of chemical weapons on the territory of other sovereign countries; and   (F)  other high-risk, disruptive efforts. 
 (4)  Continued commitment to enhancing the United States and allied force posture in Europe is indispensable for efforts to establish and sustain a credible deterrent against Russian aggression and long-term strategic competition by the Russian government. The Secretary of Defense must continue to—   (A)  support the European Deterrence Initiative and other investments in a strengthened United States and allied force posture in Europe; 
 (B)  support rotational deployments and robust exercises in the European theater;   (C)  complete efforts to establish prepositioned stocks and effective staging infrastructure to maintain credible deterrence against Russian threats; 
 (D)  invest effectively in multi-service, cyber, information, and air defense efforts to counter modern military challenges, enhance the survivability and flexibility of the United States force posture, logistics, and planning; and   (E)  consider whether additional forward-positioned forces in Europe would reduce cost and strain, enhance credibility, and strengthen capabilities. 

 1303.  Sense of Congress on security assistance to the Baltic countries

 (2)  The Secretary of Defense has completed the comprehensive Baltic Defense Assessment required by section 1246 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 and has recommended continued robust, comprehensive investment Baltic security efforts in accordance with that assessment, with assistance executed using such sections 332 and 333.   (3)  The Secretary of Defense has assessed that the authority granted by such sections 332 and 333 affords the most efficient and effective authority to provide this assistance to the Baltic countries, and that attempting to provide the assistance pursuant to alternate authorities would hamper the Department’s ability to deliver assistance and implement the investment program established by the Baltic Defense Assessment. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  Congress strongly supports the robust assistance to accomplish United States strategic objectives in accordance with sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States Code, including by providing assistance to the Baltic countries using those sections, funded by the Baltic Security Initiative. It is the sense of Congress that the security of the Baltic region is crucial to the security of the NATO alliance and these efforts are critical to ensure continued deterrence against Russian aggression and bolster allied security.

  1610B.  Leveraging commercial on-orbit satellite servicing   (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1)  National security depends on reliable access to, and safe operations in, space. Modern society is reliant on space operations, but most spacecraft today are designed to be discarded at end-of-mission, leaving potential gaps in mission continuity and contributing to risk in the space domain.   (2) Existing and future critical Department of Defense missions operating in space and providing multidomain support would benefit from the application of commercial On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (in this section referred to as  OSAM ) capabilities, which extend the longevity and operability of national security space systems through inspection, repair, refueling, and mitigation of debris.
 (3)  Because the domain in which space systems operate is increasingly congested, the risk of collisions and orbital debris generation has increased, a risk that is exacerbated by a lack of utilization of OSAM services. A secure, stable, and accessible space domain is paramount to the unimpeded and resilient operations of civil, military, intelligence, and commercial space assets by the United States and its allies. OSAM technologies support Department of Defense strategy by improving the adaptability and efficiency of existing and future military space architectures.   (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that— 
 (1)  Congress strongly encourages the Secretary of Defense to invest in developing technologies to support the advancement of debris remediation, such as rendezvous, proximity operations, and debris removal as an element of OSAM;   (2)  because of the importance of the space domain, the Secretary should seek ways to collaborate with United States industry partners and allied nations; 
 (3)  beyond technology development, the Secretary and the intelligence community should consider satellite servicing and active disposal as a viable operational trade-off—in this way, in the future, a back-up disposal plan using direct retrieval should be a preferred and viable method for relevant or off-nominal missions.   (c)  Report  Not later than December 3, 2021, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that— 
 (1)  identifies critical investment areas for the further development and usage of commercial OSAM technologies and capabilities to meet emerging and changing government space mission needs on-orbit; and   (2)  includes a plan for interagency engagement in the standardization and adoption of commercial OSAM interfaces for government space systems. 
 (d)  Appropriate congressional committees defined In this section, the term  appropriate congressional committees  means—  (1)  the congressional defense committees; 
 (2)  the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives; and   (3)  the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate. 

 1610C.  Report on sensing capabilities of the Department of Defense to assist fighting wildfires 
 (a)  Report  Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and any other head of an agency or department the Secretary determines appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the capabilities of the Department of Defense to assist fighting wildfires through the use and analysis of satellite and other aerial survey technology.   (b)  Matters included  The report under subsection (a) shall include the following: 
 (1)  An examination of the current and future sensing requirements for the wildfire fighting and analysis community.   (2)  Identification of assets of the Department of Defense and intelligence community that can provide data that is relevant to the requirements under paragraph (1), including an examination of such assets that— 
 (A)  are currently available;   (B)  are in development; and 
 (C)  have been formally proposed by a department or agency of the Federal Government, but which have not yet been approved by Congress.   (3)  With respect to the assets identified under paragraph (2)(A), an examination of how close the data such assets provide comes to meeting the wildfire management and suppression community needs. 
 (4)  An identification of the total and breakdown of costs reimbursed to the Department of Defense during the five-year period preceding the date of the report for reimbursable requests for assistance from lead departments or agencies of the Federal Government responding to natural disasters.   (5)  A discussion of issues involved in producing unclassified products using unclassified and classified assets, and policy options for Congress regarding that translation, including by explicitly addressing classification choices that could ease the application of data from such assets to wildfire detection and tracking.

 5125.  Including of Tribal Governments and Territories in the High-risk money laundering and related financial crime areas 
 (a)  Findings  The Congress finds the following:   (1) According to the Department of Justice, human trafficking is  a crime that involves exploiting a person for labor, services, or commercial sex , a global illicit trade that is estimated by Global Financial Integrity to be valued at more than $150.2 billion each year.
 (2) Polaris, the non-governmental organization which runs the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline, has found that while human trafficking is a nationwide problem, the majority of domestic human trafficking victims are  people who have historically faced discrimination and its political, social and economic consequences: people of color, indigenous communities, immigrants and people who identify as LGBTQ+ .   (3)  For this reason, it is important that law enforcement representing native communities and territories are part of the national dialogue about countering human trafficking. 
 (4)  The High Intensity Financial Crime Areas program, which is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the Federal, State, and local level to combat money laundering in designated high-intensity money laundering zones, considers human trafficking among other financial crime issues and actors.    (5)  In each High Intensity Financial Crime Area, a money-laundering action team, comprised of relevant Federal, State, and local enforcement authorities, prosecutors, and financial regulators, works together to coordinate Federal, State, and local anti-money laundering effort. 
 (6)  The High Intensity Financial Crime Area program does not currently mandate the inclusion of law enforcement and other agencies from Tribes and territories.   (7)  Further, the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, a valuable report which is scheduled to sunset in January 2022, does not currently mandate the inclusion of law enforcement and other agencies from Tribes and Territories.

 (9) Secretary of State Antony Blinken on February 26, 2021, stated:  As a matter of safety for all within our borders, perpetrators targeting perceived dissidents on behalf of any foreign government should not be permitted to reach American soil… We have made absolutely clear that extraterritorial threats and assaults by Saudi Arabia against activists, dissidents, and journalists must end. .

International cooperation   (a)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that global institutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Health Organization (WHO), together with leading nongovernmental organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote the paradigm of One Health—the integration of human health, animal health, agriculture, ecosystems, and the environment as an effective and integrated way to address the complexity of emerging disease threats. 
 (b)  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States to facilitate international cooperation by working with international partners and through intergovernmental, international, and nongovernmental organizations such as the United Nations to—   (1)  lead a resolution at the United Nations Security Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly outlining the danger to human and animal health from emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, with recommendations for implementing the worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending of the associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed and supply those markets, except for in such countries or regions where the consumption of wildlife is necessary for local food security or where such actions would significantly disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food supply; 
 (2)  work with governments through existing treaties and the United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end the associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed and supply those markets while ensuring full consideration to the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and local communities that are dependent on wildlife for their food security, national sovereignty, and local laws and customs;   (3)  disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife markets and eliminate commercial wildlife markets; 
 (4)  disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking associated with the operation of wildlife markets;   (5)  raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID–19 and reduce demand for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior change programs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process; 
 (6)  encourage and support alternate forms of food production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, especially in areas where wildlife markets play a significant role in meeting subsistence needs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process; and   (7)  strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in markets around the globe, especially those specializing in the sale of products intended for human consumption.

(2)  It is fitting to commend the dedication of students who have achieved proficiency in multiple languages and to encourage their peers to follow in their footsteps. 
 (3) The congressionally requested Commission on Language Learning, in its 2017 report  America’s Languages: Investing in Language Education for the 21st Century , notes the pressing national need for more people of the United States who are proficient in two or more languages for national security, economic growth, and the fulfillment of the potential of all people of the United States.  (4)  The Commission on Language Learning also notes the extensive cognitive, educational, and employment benefits deriving from biliteracy. 
 (5)  Biliteracy in general correlates with higher graduation rates, higher grade point averages, higher rates of matriculation into higher education, and higher earnings for all students, regardless of background.

 6483.  Sense of Congress on the use of the Defense Production Act of 1950 for global vaccine production 
 (a)  Findings  The Congress finds the following:   (1) As President Biden has stated,  We know America will never be fully safe until the pandemic that is raging globally is under control. No ocean is wide enough, no wall is high enough to keep us safe. .
 (2)  More than 600,000 Americans have already died from COVID–19. Already, more Americans have died from COVID–19 than from World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined. The continued replication of SARS-CoV-2 abroad increases the likelihood of a harmful mutation that renders current vaccines ineffective. A new variant could be more transmissible and cause more severe disease, posing a higher risk to the millions of Americans who have not been vaccinated, like the Delta variant.   (3)  Approximately 11 billion doses are needed to vaccinate the world’s population, but to date, the US government has donated just 40 million doses. More recent promises by the G7 would only deliver an additional one billion doses by the end of 2022. 
 (4)  Sharing manufacturing know-how and expertise is critical to quickly ramping up production. Expanding the world’s manufacturing capacity is critical because donations and bilateral agreements to increase vaccine doses in low- and middle-income countries cannot quickly meet the global demand.   (5)  The U.S. Government, as the largest coronavirus research and development funder in the world, is uniquely positioned to push companies to share the knowledge required to end the pandemic. 
 (6)  Manufacturers around the world have affirmed that they can help ramp up production if they have access to technology. According to the World Health Organization, 19 manufacturers from more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have expressed interest in ramping up mRNA vaccine production. The Biden administration has also urged companies to share technology. But vaccine originator corporations have been reluctant to share technology.   (7) The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides the President with broad authority to support the nation’s defense. The Defense Production Act of 1950’s definition of  national defense  includes  military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation .
 (8) The Defense Production Act of 1950 empowers the President to directly  allocate materials, services, and facilities  to promote national defense needs. The Act defines  materials  to include  any technical information or services ancillary to the use of any such materials .  (9)  The Defense Production Act of 1950 has been used repeatedly to prioritize contracts and orders from U.S. companies to foreign nations. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that the President should make full use of the President’s authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to scale vaccine production and deployment globally, which will save millions of lives and protect Americans from the risk of emerging viral threats.

 (9)  the Department and USAID are vital national security agencies, whose work is critical to the projection of United States power and leadership worldwide, and without which Americans would be less safe, United States economic power would be diminished, and global stability and prosperity would suffer;   (10)  investing in diplomacy and development before conflicts break out saves American lives while also being cost-effective; and 
 (11)  the contributions of personnel working at the Department and USAID are extraordinarily valuable and allow the United States to maintain its leadership around the world.

 (a)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—   (1)  the Department is a crucial national security agency, whose employees, both Foreign and Civil Service, require the best possible training at every stage of their careers to prepare them to promote and defend United States national interests and the health and safety of United States citizens abroad; 
 (2)  the Department of State’s investment of time and resources with respect to the training and education of its personnel is considerably below the level of other Federal departments and agencies in the national security field, and falls well below the investments many allied and adversarial countries make in the development of their diplomats;   (3)  the Department faces increasingly complex and rapidly evolving challenges, many of which are science and technology-driven, and which demand the continual, high-quality training and education of its personnel; 
 (4) the Department must move beyond reliance on  on-the-job training  and other informal mentorship practices, which lead to an inequality in skillset development and career advancement opportunities, often particularly for minority personnel, and towards a robust professional tradecraft training continuum that will provide for greater equality in career advancement and increase minority participation in the senior ranks;  (5)  the Department’s Foreign Service Institute and other training facilities should seek to substantially increase its educational and training offerings to Department personnel, including developing new and innovative educational and training courses, methods, programs, and opportunities; and 
 (6)  consistent with existing Department gift acceptance authority and other applicable laws, the Department and Foreign Service Institute may accept funds and other resources from foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and other appropriate sources to help the Department and the Institute enhance the quantity and quality of training offerings, especially in the introduction of new, innovative, and pilot model courses.   (b)  Training float Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall develop and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a strategy to establish a  training float  to allow for up to 15 percent of the Civil and Foreign Service to participate in long-term training at any given time. The strategy should identify steps necessary to ensure implementation of the training priorities identified in subsection (c), sufficient training capacity and opportunities are available to Civil and Foreign Service officers, equitable distribution of long-term training opportunities to Civil and Foreign Service officers, and any additional resources or authorities necessary to facilitate such a training float, including programs at the George P. Schultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center, the Foreign Service Institute, the Foreign Affairs Security Training Center, and other facilities or programs operated by the Department of State. The strategy shall identify which types of training would be prioritized, the extent (if any) to which such training is already being provided to Civil and Foreign Service officers by the Department of State, any factors incentivizing or disincentivizing such training, and why such training cannot be achieved without Civil and Foreign Service officers leaving the workforce. In addition to training opportunities provided by the Department, the strategy shall consider training that could be provided by the other United States Government training institutions, as well as non-governmental educational institutions. The strategy shall consider approaches to overcome disincentives to pursuing long-term training.
 (c)  Prioritization  In order to provide the Civil and Foreign Service with the level of education and training needed to effectively advance United States interests across the globe, the Department of State should—   (1)  increase its offerings— 
 (A)  of virtual instruction to make training more accessible to personnel deployed throughout the world; or   (B)  at partner organizations to provide useful outside perspectives to Department personnel; 
 (2)  offer courses utilizing computer-based or assisted simulations, allowing civilian officers to lead decision-making in a crisis environment; and   (3)  consider increasing the duration and expanding the focus of certain training courses, including— 
 (A)  the A-100 orientation course for Foreign Service officers, and   (B)  the chief of mission course to more accurately reflect the significant responsibilities accompanying such role.

  8004.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings: 
 (1)  The majority of recent emerging infectious diseases have originated in wildlife.   (2)  There is a rise in the frequency of zoonotic spillover events and outbreaks of such diseases. 
 (3)  This rise in such spillover events and outbreaks relates to the increased interaction between humans and wildlife.   (4)  There is a progressive and increasing rise in interaction between human populations and wildlife related to deforestation, habitat degradation, and expansion of human activity into the habitat of such wildlife. 
 (5)  The increase in such interactions due to these factors, particularly in forested regions of tropical countries where there is high mammalian diversity, is a serious risk factor for spillover events.   (6)  A serious risk factor for spillover events also relates to the collection, production, commercial trade, and sale for human consumption of wildlife that may transmit to zoonotic pathogens to humans that may then replicate and be transmitted within the human population. 
 (7)  Such a risk factor is increased if it involves wildlife that—   (A)  does not ordinarily interact with humans; or 
 (B)  lives under a stressful condition, as such condition exacerbates the shedding of zoonotic pathogens.   (8)  Markets for such wildlife to be sold for human consumption are found in many countries. 
 (9)  In some communities, such wildlife may be the only accessible source of high quality nutrition.   (10)  The public health emergency has resulted in— 
 (A)  trillions of dollars in economic damage to the United States; and   (B)  the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American citizens. 

 8005.  United States policy toward assisting countries in preventing zoonotic spillover events  The Secretary of State and Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the leadership of other relevant agencies, shall coordinate, engage, and work with governments, multilateral entities, intergovernmental organizations, international partners, and non-governmental organizations to—   (1)  prevent commercial trade in live wildlife and raw or unprocessed wildlife parts and derivatives for human consumption that risks contributing to zoonotic spillover, placing a priority focus on tropical countries or countries with significant markets for live wildlife for human consumption, which includes such wildlife trade activities as— 
 (A)  high volume commercial trade and associated markets;   (B)  trade in and across well connected urban centers;  
 (C)  trade for luxury consumption or where there is no dietary necessity by—   (i)  working through existing treaties, conventions, and agreements to develop a new protocol, or to amend existing protocols or agreements; and 
 (ii)  expanding combating wildlife trafficking programs to support enforcement of the closure of such markets and new illegal markets in response to closures, and the prevention of such trade, including—   (I)  providing assistance to improve law enforcement;
