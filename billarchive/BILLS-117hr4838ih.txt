 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Youth, Peace, and Security Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  There are currently 1.8 billion young people in the world, the largest number ever to have existed. One in 4 youth are directly involved in and affected by conflict.  (2)  Youth represent the majority of the population in many conflict-affected countries, where on average 50 percent of the population is below the age of 20, and in some countries more than 70 percent of the population is below the age of 30.  (3)  Around the world, youth remain under-represented in peace building and conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict relief and recovery efforts.  (4)  Violence impacts over 1 billion people globally each year.  (5)  Youth and youth-led groups and movements led by them have demonstrated the capacity to play critical roles in—  (A)  de-escalating destructive conflict from spreading;  (B)  preventing recurring cycles of violence;  (C)  effectively encouraging defection from armed groups;  (D)  improving the effectiveness and sustainability of peace processes and agreements;  (E)  improving social cohesion and tolerance between and among groups;  (F)  building resilience to violence and recruitment;  (G)  strengthening a culture of peace and security; and  (H)  contributing to improved and more inclusive democracy and governance.  (6)  Youth are critical actors in development at all levels of society, despite personal risks, operational challenges, and limited technical and financial support for their work.  (7)  Preventive and resilience-based approaches to youth are more effective at reducing violence than hard security responses and at-risk and remedial approaches, which are often counterproductive.  (8)  Youth who have participated in United States-supported civic engagement and development programs were less likely to participate in or support political violence.  (9)  Youth participation in the design and implementation of community development strategies is critical for effectively reducing violence and extremism, and increasing peace.  (10)  Young people, particularly girls, around the world face the added pressure of online harassment, which limits their ability to participate in online peacebuilding movements. In a study by PLAN International, 58 percent of girls reported that they have personally experienced some form of online harassment on social media platforms, and activists in particular attract additional harassment. In the same study, 47 percent of respondents reported being attacked for their opinions.  (11) The shrinking of global civic spaces facing youth, as documented in the United Nations Office of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Youth’s report,  If I Disappear , shows the complexity of the grave threats, challenges, and barriers against diverse groups of youth active in the civic space, taking the forms of sociocultural, financial, political, legal, digital, and physical. (12)  Many national and international mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders, peacebuilders, and humanitarians usually apply to adults and adolescents, excluding youth, due to their age.  (13)  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace, and Security, which was adopted on December 9, 2015, formalized an international framework to address the role of youth in building and sustaining peace and preventing conflict.  (14)  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2419 on Youth, Peace, and Security, which was adopted on June 6, 2018, calls for increasing and formalizing the role of youth in negotiating and implementing peace agreements.  (15)  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2535 on Youth, Peace, and Security, which was adopted on July 14, 2020, advocates for the increased protection of youth peacebuilders at risk of violence, creates a two-year reporting mechanism on Youth, Peace, and Security, and recognizes the critical role of youth in mitigating humanitarian crises, such as COVID–19. 
 3.
