 1.  Findings  The Congress finds the following:  (1) Every day, the United States Capitol Police ( Capitol Police ) protects the U.S. Capitol, Members of Congress, congressional staff and institutional staff, journalists, and the visiting public.

(3)  The sacrifice of heroes including Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who sustained injuries, and the courage of Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, exemplify the patriotism and the commitment of Capitol Police officers, and those of other law enforcement agencies, to risk their lives in service of our country.  (4)  Up to seven Americans died following this violent attack, and more than 140 law enforcement officers suffered physical injuries, including 15 officers who were hospitalized.  (5)  The desecration of the U.S. Capitol, which is the temple of our American Democracy, and the violence targeting Congress are horrors that will forever stain our Nationâ€™s history.  (6) On April 2, 2021, Officer William  Billy  Evans was killed while protecting the North Barricade of the Capitol. Officer Evans was a distinguished member of the First Responders Unit and an eighteen-year veteran of the United States Capitol Police. Also injured in that assault was Officer Kenneth Shaver.
