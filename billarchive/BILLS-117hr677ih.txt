Incentivizing banning of chokeholds  (a)  Sense of congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  chokeholds are extremely dangerous maneuvers that can easily result in serious bodily injury or death;  (2)  George Floyd’s death has become a flashpoint to compel the need to address the use of chokeholds by law enforcement officers across the United States;  (3)  the National Consensus Policy on Use of Force, a collaborative effort among 11 of the most significant law enforcement leadership and labor organizations in the United States, concluded in a discussion paper on the use of force that chokeholds are extremely dangerous and recommended restricting their use, consistent with this section; and  (4)  law enforcement agencies throughout the United States must create policies that guard against the use of this maneuver to help prevent the death of civilians whom they encounter, and engender more trust and faith among law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.  (b)  Incentivizing banning of chokeholds  (1)  COPS grant program eligibility Section 1701 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 ( 34 U.S.C. 10381 ), as amended by section 501 of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following: (o)  Banning of chokeholds  (1)  Chokehold defined In this subsection, the term  chokehold  means a physical maneuver that restricts an individual’s ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation.

 106.  Falsifying police incident reports  (a)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  when a law enforcement officer commits an offense that deprives a citizen of their rights, privileges, and immunities protected under the Constitution and laws of the United States, that behavior is penalized to punish those involved and to deter future conduct;  (2)  where serious bodily injury or death results from the acts described in paragraph (1), punishment must be severe;  (3)  a law enforcement officer who intentionally submits a false police report in connection with an act described in paragraph (1) should also be punished severely;  (4)  false reporting described in paragraph (3) not only serves to conceal potential criminal conduct and obstruct the administration of justice, false reporting also undermines the trust and confidence that communities place in law enforcement agencies;  (5)  obstruction of justice is intolerable in any form, particularly in the form described in this subsection;  (6)  the deterioration of trust and confidence between law enforcement agencies and communities must be abated; and  (7)  severe penalties must be imposed for individuals who create false police reports in connection with criminal civil rights violations resulting in serious bodily injury or death.   (b)  Offense  Chapter 47  of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: 1041.  False reporting  (a)  Offense  It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and willfully falsify a police report in a material way with the intent to falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, in furtherance of the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States where death or serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) occurs.

 IV  Justice for Victims of Lynching  401.  Short title This title may be cited as the  Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2021 .
 402.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction.  (2)  Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the middle of the 20th century.  (3)  Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States.  (4)  At least 4,742 people, predominantly African Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968.  (5)  Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials.  (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (referred to in this section as the  NAACP ) and prompted members of B'nai B'rith to found the Anti-Defamation League. (7)  Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror.  (8)  Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century.  (9)  Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching.  (10)  Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures.  (11)  Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so.  (12) The publication of  Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America  helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching. (13)  Only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad.  (14)  An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged.  (15)  Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history is the only way the country can effectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to apologize to the victims of lynching and the descendants of those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation.  (16)  The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened to the public in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation’s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, people terrorized by lynching, African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence.  (17)  Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology and the heightened awareness and education about the Nation’s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime.  (18)  Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal object of that group will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify criminal penalties for the crime of lynching, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching.  (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017,  [c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism, religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States  and taking notice specifically of Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics demonstrating that  among single-bias hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ancestral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by the offenders’ anti-Black or anti-African American bias . (20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 ( Public Law 115–58 ; 131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress  condemn[ed] the racist violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia  and  urg[ed] the President and his administration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources available to the President and the President’s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States . (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 ( Public Law 115–58 ; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of  hundreds of torch-bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant slogans and violently engaged with counter-demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville  and that these groups  reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in the United States and communities everywhere are concerned about the growing and open display of hate and violence being perpetrated by those groups . (22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive tool that was used to interfere with multiple aspects of life—including the exercise of Federally protected rights, as enumerated in section 245 of title 18, United States Code, housing rights, as enumerated in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 ( 42 U.S.C. 3631 ), and the free exercise of religion, as enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States Code. Interference with these rights was often effectuated by multiple offenders and groups, rather than isolated individuals. Therefore, prohibiting conspiracies to violate each of these rights recognizes the history of lynching in the United States and serves to prohibit its use in the future.
 403.  Lynching  (a)  Offense  Chapter 13  of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: 250.  Lynching Whoever conspires with another person to violate section 245, 247, or 249 of this title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 ( 42 U.S.C. 3631 ) shall be punished in the same manner as a completed violation of such section, except that if the maximum term of imprisonment for such completed violation is less than 10 years, the person may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.
 .  (b)  Table of sections amendment The table of sections for  chapter 13  of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to  section 249  the following: 250. Lynching.  .

 602.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  it is in the interest of the United States to establish a commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system;  (2)  there has not been a comprehensive study since the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice was established in 1965;  (3) in a span of 18 months, the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice produced a comprehensive report entitled  The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society , which contained 200 specific recommendations on all aspects of the criminal justice system involving— (A)  Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments;  (B)  civic organizations;  (C)  religious institutions;  (D)  business groups; and  (E)  individual citizens; and  (4)  developments over the intervening 50 years require once again that Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, law enforcement agencies, including rank and file officers, civil rights organizations, community-based organization leaders, civic organizations, religious institutions, business groups, and individual citizens come together to review evidence and consider how to improve the criminal justice system.
