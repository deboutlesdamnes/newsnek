 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Community Vehicle Charging Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  the transportation sector is the highest emitting sector of greenhouse gases in the United States;  (2)  transportation is a significant source of toxic air pollutants;  (3)  electrification is considered 1 of the most feasible and affordable opportunities to decarbonize transportation in the near-term, and thus reduce pollutants harmful to public health;  (4)  the adoption of electric vehicles is dependent on adequate access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure;  (5)  publicly available electric vehicle charging infrastructure has been distributed inequitably, and not all people of the United States have the ability to access electric vehicle charging infrastructure at home or at work;   (6)  range anxiety and a lack of access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure are significant barriers to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles;  (7)  access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure differs from proximity to electric vehicle charging infrastructure;  (8)  environmental justice communities face several barriers to accessing electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and funding programs to install electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including—  (A)  the high cost of, and a lack of knowledge about, electric vehicles;  (B)  the high cost of—  (i)  level 2 electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and   (ii)  fast charging electric vehicle charging infrastructure;  (C)  a lack of awareness of the availability of—  (i)  electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and  (ii)  funding programs to install electric vehicle charging infrastructure;  (D)  a lack of technical support and up-front funding for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure;  (E)  a low level of homeownership in environmental justice communities;  (F)  the high percentage of individuals and families in environmental justice communities who reside in multi-unit dwellings;  (G)  linguistic isolation; and  (H)  the short timelines for electric vehicle charging infrastructure projects; and  (9)  effective programs for environmental justice communities to access electric vehicle charging infrastructure and funding programs for the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure need to be targeted to overcome the barriers described in paragraph (8).
