 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Priority Response for Veterans Impacted by Disasters and Emergencies Act  or the  PROVIDE Act . 
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  The Department of Veterans Affairs sets forth criteria for priority processing of veterans’ disability claims by the Department.  (2)  Such criteria include veterans affected by extreme financial hardship, homelessness, terminal illness, and participants in the Department’s Fully Developed Claim program.   (3)  Currently there is no process in place to prioritize the disability claims of veterans affected by major disasters such as fires and floods.  (4)  Priority claims processing for veterans affected by major disasters will significantly help such veterans begin rebuilding their lives.  
 3.  Priority Claims Processing in the Event of a Major Disaster  (a)  In general The Secretary shall prescribe regulations setting forth criteria for priority processing of a claim for compensation under  chapter 11  of title 38, United States Code. Individuals whose claim shall be eligible for such priority processing shall include— (1)  veterans affected by extreme financial hardship;  (2)  veterans affected by homelessness;  (3)  veterans diagnosed with a terminal illness;  (4)  participants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Fully Developed Claim program; and  (5) veterans who live in an area for which the President has declared a major disaster under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5170 ). (b)  Special considerations for claims processing in the event of a major disaster  The Secretary shall prescribe additional regulations relating only to subsection (a)(5). Such additional regulations include—  (1)  establishing flexible evidence requirements for veterans unable to meet the ordinary evidence requirements for such a claim due to a major disaster; and  (2)  establishing a flexible filing deadline for such a claim.  (c)  Notice to veterans of eligibility for priority claims processing  Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall post a permanent notice to veterans on the Department of Veterans Affairs website of the categories of eligibility for priority processing of such claims, including the changes to such categories made pursuant to subsection (a).
