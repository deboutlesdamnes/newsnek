 1.  Short title  (a)  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Fair Pay Act of 2021 . (b)  Reference Except as provided in section 8, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ( 29 U.S.C. 201  et seq.).
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Wage rate differentials exist between equivalent jobs segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.  (2)  Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a role in maintaining a segregated work force.  (3)  Many women and people of color work in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin.  (A)  While a wage rate differential exists in nearly every occupational field, traditionally male jobs tend to pay better than traditionally female jobs which require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.  (B)  Traditionally male jobs that are low-wage require less skill, education, and certifications than traditionally female jobs that are low-wage, despite their generally receiving higher pay.  (4)  In 2015, a woman in the United States working in a full-time, year-round job earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man working in a full-time, year-round job.  (A)  The wage gap is larger when the data is disaggregated by race. Among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United States, African-American women were paid on average, only 63 percent of what White men were paid in 2015, while Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander women were paid 60 percent, American Indian and Alaska Native women were paid 58 percent, and Hispanic and Latina women were paid only 54 percent.  (B)  The gender pay gap persists across educational levels. As a result, women who complete college degrees are less able to pay off their student loans promptly, leaving them paying more and for a longer time than men. In 2012, among students who graduated in 2007–2008, women working full time had paid off 33 percent of their student loan debt on average, while men working full time had paid off 44 percent of their debt.  (C)  In the United States, mothers are primary or sole breadwinners in nearly 40 percent of families. Yet the wage gap for mothers is larger than for women overall. According to 2013 data, mothers employed full time, year round are paid 71 cents for every dollar paid to fathers. It is worse for single mothers with full-time, year-round jobs, who are paid just 58 cents for every dollar paid to fathers.  (D)  A conservative estimate is that women employed in the United States lose a combined total of nearly $500 billion every year due to the wage gap. These women, their families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result. Lost wages mean families have less money to save for the future or to spend on basic goods and services—spending that helps drive the economy.  (E)  Statistical analysis shows that 62 percent of the wage gap can be attributed to occupational and industry differences; differences in experience and education; and factors such as race, region and unionization. That leaves 38 percent of the gap unaccounted for, leading researchers to conclude that factors such as discrimination and unconscious bias continue to affect women’s wages.  (5)  The existence of such wage rate differentials—  (A)  depresses wages and living standards for employees necessary for their health and efficiency;  (B)  prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor resources;  (C)  tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing commerce;  (D)  burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;  (E)  constitutes an unfair method of competition; and  (F)  contributes to poor living conditions, poor nutrition, and fewer opportunities for families with children under 18 where the mother is the sole or primary breadwinner.  (6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 prohibits discrimination in compensation for  equal work  on the basis of sex. (7) Artificial barriers to the elimination of discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and national origin continue to exist more than five decades after the passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000a  et seq.). Elimination of such barriers would have positive effects. (A)  Problems in the economy created by discrimination through wage rate differentials would be reduced. In 2012, the U.S. economy would have produced additional income of $447.6 billion if women received equal pay; this represents 2.9 percent of 2012 gross domestic product.  (B)  Fewer working women and people of color would earn low wages, thereby reducing dependence on public assistance. The total increase in women’s earnings with pay equity represents more than 14 times what the Federal and State governments spent in fiscal year 2012 on Temporary Assistance to Needy Families.  (C)  Working family members earning a fair rate of pay would encourage stable families and reduce poverty. The poverty rate for all working women would be cut in half, falling to 3.9 percent from 8.1 percent. The very high poverty rate for working single mothers would fall by nearly half, from 28.7 percent to 15.0 percent, and two-thirds would receive a pay increase. 
 3.  Equal pay for equivalent jobs  (a)  Amendment Section 6 ( 29 U.S.C. 206 ) is amended by adding at the end the following: (h)  (1)  (A)  Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no employer having employees subject to any provision of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex, race, or national origin by paying wages to employees in such establishment in a job that is dominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or national origin at a rate less than the rate at which the employer pays wages to employees in such establishment in another job that is dominated by employees of the opposite sex or of a different race or national origin, respectively, for work on equivalent jobs, nor shall such employer between such employees on the basis of sex, race, or national origin in any other terms, conditions, privileges, or benefits of employment.  (B)  Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall prohibit the payment of different wage rates to employees where such payment is made pursuant to—  (i)  a seniority system;  (ii)  a merit system;  (iii)  a system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or  (iv)  a differential based on a bona fide factor other than sex, race, or national origin, such as education, training, or experience, except that this clause shall apply only if—  (I)  the employer demonstrates that—  (aa)  such factor—  (AA)  is job-related with respect to the position in question; or  (BB)  furthers a legitimate business purpose, except that this item shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an alternative employment practice exists that would serve the same business purpose without producing such differential and that the employer has refused to adopt such alternative practice; and  (bb)  such factor was actually applied and used reasonably in light of the asserted justification; and  (II)  upon the employer succeeding under subclause (I), the employee fails to demonstrate that the differential produced by the reliance of the employer on such factor is itself the result of discrimination on the basis of sex, race, or national origin by the employer.  (C)  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue guidelines specifying criteria for determining whether a job is dominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or national origin for purposes of subparagraph (B)(iv). Such guidelines shall not include a list of such jobs.  (D)  An employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of subparagraph (A) shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of such subparagraph, reduce the wage rate of any employee.  (2)  No labor organization or its agents representing employees of an employer having employees subject to any provision of this section shall cause or attempt to cause such an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of paragraph (1)(A).  (3)  For purposes of administration and enforcement of this subsection, any amounts owing to any employee that have been withheld in violation of paragraph (1)(A) shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this section or section 7.  (4)  In this subsection:  (A) The term  labor organization  means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and that exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work. (B) The term  equivalent jobs  means jobs that may be dissimilar, but whose requirements are equivalent, when viewed as a composite of skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. .
