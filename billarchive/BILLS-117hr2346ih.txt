 (II)  that runs on electricity, it has a Coefficient of Performance of 3 or more,   (viii)  in the case of a water-cooled centrifugal chiller package, it meets the prescriptive option of the International Green Construction Code (2018), 
 (ix)  in the case of insulation for heating and cooling supply and return ducts, it meets the prescriptive option for duct insulation of the International Green Construction Code (2018) and its applicable Normative Appendix,   (x)  in the case of roofing, walls, and associated insulation, it meets the prescriptive option for building envelope opaque elements of the International Green Construction Code (2018) and its applicable Normative Appendix,

 (xiii)  in the case of sensors and controls, it is a device that automatically controls the operation of other qualified equipment without manual operation of a switch, using technology such as motion or occupancy detection, infrared, ultrasonic, microwave, audio-based, image-processing, temperature, humidity, time-scheduling, bi-level, or demand-response, and   (xiv)  in the case of a variable speed or frequency drive, it is a drive— 
 (I)  added to adjust the speed and torque of an operational motor that powers pump, fan, exhaust, ventilation, air-handling, or compressor equipment, and   (II)  controlled automatically by a building automation system, process control system, or local controller driven by differential pressure flow, temperature or another variable signal.
