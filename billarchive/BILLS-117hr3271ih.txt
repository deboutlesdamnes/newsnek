 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Climate Change Health Protection and Promotion Act of 2021 .
 2.  Sense of Congress on public health and climate change  (a)  Findings  The U.S. Global Change Research Program Climate and Health Assessment states that—  (1)  the impacts of human-induced climate change are increasing nationwide;  (2)  rising greenhouse gas concentrations result in increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, increases in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events, and rising sea levels;  (3)  these climate change impacts endanger our health by affecting our food and water sources, the air we breathe, the weather we experience, and our interactions with the built and natural environments; and  (4)  as the climate continues to change, the risks to human health continue to grow.  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—  (1)  climate change poses threats to the United States and globally through its impacts on society, the economy, the physical environment, and national security;  (2)  climate change health threats are growing in scale and severity;  (3)  climate change disproportionately affects people of the United States who are economically disadvantaged, belong to communities of color, or have other social and health vulnerabilities;  (4)  climate change impacts anywhere in the world can threaten the health of people of the United States through such pathways as infectious disease pandemics, climate-driven migration and displacement, and social, economic, and political disruption; and  (5)  the Federal Government, in cooperation with international, State, Tribal, and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and individuals, should use all practicable means and measures—  (A)  to assist the efforts of public health and health care professionals, first responders, health care systems, States, the District of Columbia, territories, municipalities, and Native American and local communities to incorporate measures to prepare public health and health care systems to respond to the impacts of climate change;  (B)  to ensure—  (i)  that the Nation’s public health and health care professionals have sufficient information to prepare for and respond to the adverse health impacts of climate change;  (ii)  the application of scientific research in advancing understanding of—  (I)  the health impacts of climate change; and  (II)  strategies to prepare for and respond to the health impacts of climate change;  (iii)  the identification of communities and populations vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, including infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with disabilities or pre-existing illnesses, low-income populations, communities of color, those who experience environmental injustices, and unhoused individuals;  (iv)  the development of strategic response plans to be carried out by public health and health care professionals for the communities described in clause (iii);  (v)  the improvement of health status and health equity through efforts to prepare for and respond to climate change; and  (vi)  the inclusion of health impacts in the development of climate change responses;  (C)  to encourage further research, interdisciplinary partnership, and collaboration among stakeholders in order to—  (i)  understand and monitor the health impacts of climate change, including mental health impacts;  (ii)  improve public health knowledge and response strategies to climate change;  (iii)  identify actions and policies that are beneficial to health and that mitigate climate health impacts; and  (iv)  develop strategies to address water-, food-, and vector-borne infectious diseases and other public health emergencies;  (D)  to enhance preparedness activities, and health care and public health infrastructure, relating to climate change and health;  (E)  to encourage each and every community to learn about the impacts of climate change on health; and  (F)  to assist the efforts of developing countries to incorporate measures to prepare public health and health care systems to respond to the impacts of climate change.
