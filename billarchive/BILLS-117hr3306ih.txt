
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Uyghur Stop Oppressive Sterilizations Act  or the  Uyghur SOS Act .
  2.  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1)  Eyewitness accounts provide credible documentation of widespread forced sterilization and sexual violence against Uyghur and Kazakh women in the People’s Republic of China, including investigations and independent interviews by global media outlets.   (2)  Women who survived internment camps report that they were forced to undergo multiple injections of unknown medicines that caused temporary or permanent loss of menstrual cycles. 
 (3) Chinese Government documents demonstrate rapid declines in population in two predominately Uyghur prefectures of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region between 2015 and 2018, and an unprecedented near-zero birth rate target for 2020 in one district. Government documents mandate that birth control violations are punishable by extrajudicial internment in  training  camps.  (4)  Chinese Government documents from 2019 reveal plans for a campaign of mass female sterilization in rural Uyghur populated regions of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, to be continued in 2020 with increased funding. Publicly available budgets indicate that this project had sufficient funding to perform hundreds of thousands of tubal ligation sterilization procedures in 2019 and 2020. 
 (5)  In 2019, the Government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region planned to subject at least 80 percent of women of childbearing age in the four southern, rural, minority prefectures to intrusive birth-prevention surgeries.   (6) A leaked report written by Nankai University researchers for the Chinese Government confirms the intent of intention of state-organized forced labor transfers as having the ultimate purpose of assimilating Uyghurs,  breaking up  their society, and altering demographic trends.
 (7) The policy of state-sponsored forced population-transfer program, which separates married couples and forcibly places unmarried individuals into controlled environments where they cannot marry or form a family, is a violation of the fundamental right  to marry and to found a family,  as codified by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).  (8) Under the  becoming family  homestay program initiated by the government of the People’s Republic of China in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, government workers and other Communist Party members are assigned to live with ethnic minority families in their homes to conduct surveillance and compile information on family members, in arrangements which leave these families vulnerable to sexual violence and other types of abuse.
 (9) On January 7, 2021, an official social media account for the Government of China said that a  Study shows that in the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of Uygur women in Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines [and] … . They are more confident and independent. .  (10)  Uyghur and Kazakh women who have given testimony to reporters about sexual violence and forced sterilizations in mass internment camps have been intimidated and their families threatened by security officials from the People’s Republic of China. 
 (11)  Article Two of the Genocide Convention of 1948, which China has signed and ratified, states that    genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: 
 (A)  Killing members of the group;   (B)  Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; 
 (C)  Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;   (D)  Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; 
 (E)  Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.  .   (12) On January 19, 2021, the Secretary of State released a determination about atrocities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region that stated that the  ongoing  crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups include forced sterilization, and called upon the PRC  immediately to release all arbitrarily detained persons and abolish its system of internment, detention camps, house arrest and forced labor; cease coercive population control measures, including forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced birth control, and the removal of children from their families; and end all torture and abuse in places of detention . . . . 
 (13) That same determination concluded that, after careful examination of the facts, the Government of China was committing  genocide  against Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.  (14) Secretary of State Tony Blinken affirmed that the United States Government recognizes the atrocities faced by Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity and said the United States will hold the Government of China responsible for the  atrocities  committed in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

 3.  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States—   (1)  to regard the prevention of genocide and other atrocity crimes as a national interest particularly when those actions target Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz and other predominately Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region through mass arbitrary detentions, forced labor, forced sterilizations, forced abortions and other coercive birth restrictions policies, sexual violence and other torture in detention, and forced transfer of children to orphanages and boarding schools; 
 (2)  to condemn genocide and work diplomatically to end genocide and other atrocity crimes, including by calling on foreign governments, through both bilateral discussions and in multilateral organizations, to denounce and take actions to end the atrocity crimes perpetuated in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;   (3)  to raise the issue of state-sanctioned violence against women, including rape, torture, and coercively enforced population control policies in the People’s Republic of China, in all multilateral organizations where the United States and the People’s Republic of China are members, including at the United Nations Security Council; 
 (4)  to consider state-sanctioned violence against women, including forced sterilizations and forced abortions and the systematic use of rape and torture in mass internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as a gross violation of internationally-recognized human rights; and   (5) to use all the existing United States authorities, including visa and financial sanctions, to hold accountable individuals and entities responsible for genocide and other atrocity crimes in the People’s Republic of China, section 6 of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act (Public Law No: 116–145) and including section 1263 of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017;  22 U.S.C. 2656  note).

 4.  Sense of Congress concerning atrocity crimes in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region  It is the sense of Congress that—   (1)  the atrocities perpetrated by the Government of the People’s Republic of China against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other predominately Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are horrific and ongoing and constitute genocide and crimes against humanity; 
 (2)  all governments, including the United States, and international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Office of the Secretary-General, should call the atrocities perpetuated by the Government of the People’s Republic of China, including the mass arbitrary detention of ethnic minorities; forced sterilizations and forced abortions and other sexual violence; and forced labor, as genocide and crimes against humanity;   (3)  the United States, in coordination with allies and partners, should strongly condemn the intimidation and threats targeting Uyghur and Kazakh women who provide public evidence of sexual violence and forced sterilizations and forced abortions in mass internment camps and the journalist who report these stories; 
 (4)  member states of the United Nations should consider all Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities detained and imprisoned through the justice system in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as arbitrarily detained due to the severe restrictions on information regarding the cases and because research by human rights organizations indicate that long prison sentences were given to individuals for practicing their religion or engaging in other internationally-recognized human rights;   (5)  member states of the United Nations should condemn the atrocities committed by the Government of the People’s Republic China, including forced sterilizations and other state-sanctioned violence against women, and take steps to prevent further crimes against humanity and genocide in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region including by demanding that the Government of the People’s Republic of China— 
 (A)  immediately adhere to its commitments under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;   (B)  end all forced sterilization, forced abortions, and other state-sanctioned violence against women; 
 (C)  release all individuals from internment camps, and all others who are unjustly or arbitrarily detained, including those engaged in forced labor programs or separated from their families in state-run boarding schools;   (D)  end harassment and restrictions on foreign journalists while they are traveling in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and immediately end any threats and intimidation directed at journalists for reporting about conditions there; and 
 (E)  guarantee the right to the freedom of religion, including by rebuilding mosques and restoring holy sites and cemeteries;   (6)  member states of the United Nations should take action to collect and preserve evidence of genocide and crimes against humanity and establish appropriate special mechanisms and tribunals to hold accountable officials responsible for genocide and crimes against humanity, including through the establishment of an international Commission on Inquiry on Atrocity Crimes in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; and 
 (7)  the Department of State should be commended for raising the issue of atrocity crimes and its public determination that the Government of the People’s Republic of China is responsible for an ongoing genocide and for crimes against humanity in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

 (2)  a strategy for ending the atrocity crimes occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including by—   (A)  holding accountable persons or entities responsible for committing such atrocity crimes by addressing, through existing or new export controls or import restrictions, the issues of mass biometric surveillance and forced labor programs in China; 
 (B)  gaining access for United Nations, United States, and other diplomats and foreign journalists to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; and   (C)  protecting Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic minorities affected by the atrocities committed by the Government of the People’s Republic of China.
