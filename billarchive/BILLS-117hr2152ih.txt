
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act of 2021 .
  2.  Purpose and findings   (a)  Purpose  The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to States, units of local government, and Indian Tribes to reform their criminal justice system to encourage the replacement of the use of payment of money bail as a condition of pretrial release in criminal cases. 
 (b)  Findings  Congress finds the following:   (1)  The justice system of the United States, a cornerstone of our free society, is built on the ideals that all accused people are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty, that all accused people have the right to assert their innocence in a trial, that liberty should not be denied absent due process of law, that rich and poor people should be treated equally, and that people should be judged by their own individual actions, and not prejudged based on the actions of others. 
 (2)  Pretrial detention and the money bail systems prevalent in most States undermine these ideals by jailing people unnecessarily before a finding of guilt and with minimal due process, and by establishing a system that allows wealthy people to pay for their liberty, while poor people remain in jail.   (3)  The inability to post money bail may result in innocent people pleading guilty to low-level crimes they did not commit so they can be released. 
 (4)  Money bail systems have resulted in disparate harms to poor people and communities of color. Compared to white men charged with the same crime and with the same criminal histories, African-American men receive bail amounts that are 35 percent higher, and for Latino men, bail is set 19 percent higher than for white men.   (5)  African Americans are 24 percent more likely to be denied bail and 21 percent less likely to be granted non-financial release than whites with similar legal characteristics. Latinos are 25 percent less likely to be granted nonfinancial conditions of release. 
 (6)  Although most women in jail are charged with nonviolent crimes, women are less likely to be able to afford money bail, and women in jail before trial earn scarcely more per year than the average bail amount of $10,000.   (7)  Detaining people who would otherwise be highly likely to succeed in pretrial compliance, even just for a few days, is strongly correlated with higher rates of new criminal activity both during the pretrial period and years after case disposition. 
 (8)  When held for 2 to 3 days, people who would have been highly likely to succeed in their communities are almost 40 percent more likely to be arrested for new crimes before trial than similarly situated defendants held no more than 24 hours.   (9)  Court reminder programs are a low-cost, highly effective way of improving court appearance rates. One review of different forms of court reminders found failure-to-appear rates were reduced by 23 to 43 percent with the use of reminders. 
 (10)  Pretrial supervision is most effective for people with a decreased probability of appearing in court, reducing failures to appear by 33 to 38 percent.   (11)  Jailing individuals before trial is the greatest expense generated by current pretrial justice practice. Unconvicted detainees account for 95 percent of jail population growth, nationally, since 2000. Taxpayers now spend approximately $38,000,000 per day to jail individuals who are awaiting trial. Annually, this adds up to $14,000,000,000 used to detain individuals.
