 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Tracking COVID–19 Variants Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  new variants of SARS–CoV–2 are being identified around the world and in the United States;  (2)  identifying new variants of SARS–CoV–2 and analyzing the epidemiology of variants are critical to the continued response to the COVID–19 pandemic and efforts to prepare for future pandemics;  (3)  national sequence-based surveillance will enable the United States to best identify new variants; and  (4)  the United States is conducting sequence-based surveillance of approximately 0.3 percent of COVID–19 cases, lagging far behind other nations.

(d)  Facilities  Funds appropriated under subsection (f) may be used for grants for the construction, alteration, or renovation of non-federally owned facilities to improve genetic sequencing and surveillance capabilities at the State and local level.  (e)  Expansion of ongoing activities  Funds appropriated under subsection (f) may be used for grants for the maintenance and expansion of current and ongoing activities to analyze and interpret data produced through advanced molecular detection and genomic sequencing, including for emerging public health threats.  (f)  Authorization of appropriations  There is authorized to be appropriated, $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2021 to carry out this section, to remain available until expended. 
 5.  Evidence-building demonstration program  (a)  In general The Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Center for Health Statistics, shall carry out a demonstration program to expand the data linkage program of the Department of Health and Human Services, consisting of Federal statistical and programmatic datasets from specified Federal entities, as authorized by subchapter III of  chapter 35  of title 44, United States Code, for the purpose of facilitating statistical public health research on trends and patterns across specifically defined, statistically relevant populations, with a particular focus on linking social determinants of health data, including with respect to— (1)  food insecurity;  (2)  housing instability;  (3)  transportation access;  (4)  safety;  (5)  social connection and isolation;  (6)  financial resource strain;  (7)  stress;  (8)  race and ethnicity; and  (9)  sexual orientation and gender identity.  (b)  Activities  Activities carried out under the demonstration program under this section shall include—  (1)  assessing the availability of identified and de-identified data sets held by Federal, State, local, and non-Federal entities that may be useful for research described in subsection (a); and  (2) using existing authorities and linkages of data in accordance with subchapter III of  chapter 35  of title 44, United States Code, when relevant to request the submission of datasets to the National Center for Health Statistics for linking. (c)  Limitation  The Secretary shall limit access to data under the demonstration program under this section—  (1)  to Federal statistical agencies and qualified public and private researchers, as determined by the Director of the National Center for Health Statistics;  (2)  for a period to be specified by the Secretary; and  (3)  exclusively for the purpose described in subsection (a).  (d)  Process for making data available  (1)  In general  Consistent with paragraph (2), the Secretary shall establish a rigorous process for making data available and usable under the demonstration program under this section.
