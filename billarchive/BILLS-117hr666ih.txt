 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Anti-Racism in Public Health Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by the National Museum of African American History and Culture as an  overarching system of racial bias across institutions and society,  in the United States has negatively affected communities of color, especially Black, Latinx, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and American Indian and Alaska Native people, to expand and reinforce White supremacy. (2)  Structural racism determines the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age and determine people’s access to quality housing, education, food, transportation, and political power, and other social determinants of health.  (3)  Structural racism serves as a major barrier to achieving health equity and eliminating racial and ethnic inequities in health outcomes that exist at alarming rates and are determined by a wider set of forces and systems.  (4)  Due to structural racism in the United States, people of color are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, hepatitis, and hypertension) and infectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, and COVID–19) compared to their White counterparts.  (5)  Due to structural racism in maternal health care in the United States, Black and American Indian and Alaska Native infants are more than twice as likely to die than White infants, Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women, and American Indian and Alaska Native women are 5 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women. This trend persists even when adjusting for income and education.  (6)  Due to structural racism in the United States, Non-Hispanic Black women have the highest rates for 22 of 25 severe morbidity indicators used by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  (7)  Due to structural racism in the United States, people of color comprise a disproportionate percentage of persons with disabilities in the United States.  (8)  Due to structural racism in the United States, Black men are up to three and a half times as likely to be killed by police as White men, and 1 in every 1,000 Black men will die as a result of police violence. Policing has adverse effects on mental health in Black communities.   (9)  Due to the confluence of structural racism and factors such as gender, class, and sexual orientation or gender identity, commonly referred to as intersectionality, Black and Latinx transgender women are more likely to die due to violence and homicide than their White counterparts.   (10)  Due to structural racism, inequitable access to quality health care and longterm services and supports also disproportionately burdens communities of color; people of color and immigrants are less likely to be insured and are more likely to live in medically underserved areas.  (11)  Due to structural racism, older adults of color are also more likely to be admitted to nursing homes and assisted living facilities and to reside in those of poor quality, and when older adults of color do receive home and community based services, Medicaid spends less money on their services and they are more likely to be hospitalized than older White adults.  (12)  In addition, the Federal Government’s failure to honor the unique political status of American Indian and Alaska Native people, to respect the inherent sovereignty of Tribal Nations, and to uphold its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of oppression, with the consequence of adverse health outcomes for Native peoples.  (13)  The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the devastating impact of structural racism on the United States ability to ensure equitable health outcomes for people of color, and made these communities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes due to the coronavirus infection.  (14)  Racial and ethnic inequity in public health is a result of systematic, personally mediated, and internalized racism and racist public and private policies and practices, and dismantling structural racism is integral to addressing public health. 
 3.  Definitions  In this Act:  (1)  Antiracism The term  antiracism  is a collection of antiracist policies that lead to racial equity, and are substantiated by antiracist ideas. (2)  Antiracist The term  antiracist  is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups.
 4.

The Center shall promote public health by— (A)  declaring racism a public health crisis and naming racism as an historical and present threat to the physical and mental health and well-being of the United States and world;  (B)  aiming to develop new knowledge in the science and practice of antiracism, including by identifying the mechanisms by which racism operates in the provision of health care and in systems that impact health and well-being;  (C)  transferring that knowledge into practice, including by developing interventions that dismantle the mechanisms of racism and replace such mechanisms with equitable structures, policies, practices, norms, and values so that a healthy society can be realized; and  (D)  contributing to a national and global conversation regarding the impacts of racism on the health and well-being of the United States and world.   (2)  General duties  The Secretary, acting through the Center, shall undertake activities to carry out the mission of the Center as described in paragraph (1), such as the following:  (A)  Conduct research into, collect, analyze and make publicly available data on, and provide leadership and coordination for the science and practice of antiracism, the public health impacts of structural racism, and the effectiveness of intervention strategies to address these impacts. Topics of research and data collection under this subparagraph may include identifying and understanding—  (i)  policies and practices that have a disparate impact on the health and well-being of communities of color;  (ii)  the public health impacts of implicit racial bias, White supremacy, weathering, xenophobia, discrimination, and prejudice;  (iii)  the social determinants of health resulting from structural racism, including poverty, housing, employment, political participation, and environmental factors; and  (iv)  the intersection of racism and other systems of oppression, including as related to age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability status.

(C)  Establish, through grants or cooperative agreements, at least 3 regional centers of excellence, located in racial and ethnic minority communities, in antiracism for the purpose of developing new knowledge in the science and practice of antiracism in health by researching, understanding, and identifying the mechanisms by which racism operates in the health space, racial and ethnic inequities in health care access and outcomes, the history of successful antiracist movements in health, and other antiracist public health work.  (D)  Establish a clearinghouse within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the collection and storage of data generated under the programs implemented under this section for which there is not an otherwise existing surveillance system at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
