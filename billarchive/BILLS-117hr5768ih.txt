 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Violent Incident Clearance and Technological Investigative Methods Act of 2021  or the  VICTIM Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Research indicates that law enforcement agencies can impact clearance rates by improving investigative processes, detective effort, and organizational oversight and supervision of investigations.  (2)  Law enforcement agencies that demonstrate higher rates of clearance for homicides and non-fatal shootings—  (A)  have more structured oversight and formal interactions between investigative units and agency leadership;   (B)  are more likely to have investigative units that have good relationships with other units and that share information well with other units;   (C)  have investigative units that have specific goals and performance metrics for both the unit and for investigators within that unit; tend to assign most, if not all, serious crimes to an investigator, at least for preliminary review;   (D)  have investigators who more frequently respond to the initial crime scene shortly after crimes have been reported;  (E)  have investigators who either have (or are required to have) specialized experience before joining investigative units or are expected to be trained on specific skills once they join those units;   (F)  often have standard operating procedures for investigations, where cases are managed carefully and have requirements for completion;   (G)  tend to support their investigative units, both in terms of resources, as well as symbolically; and  (H)  have better relationships with their community, even if no specific community-oriented campaign or initiative exists between investigative units and community groups.  (3)  Criminal justice agencies should collaborate among each other and share best practices for solving homicides and non-fatal shootings.  (4)  A comprehensive community engagement strategy concerning gun violence is essential to improve clearance rates for homicides and non-fatal shootings.
