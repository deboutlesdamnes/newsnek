 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Reading Early and Addressing Dyslexia Act  or the  READ Act . 
 2.  Findings; sense of Congress  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:   (1)  More than 30,000,000 adults in the United States are not able to read or write above a third-grade level.  (2)  Of adults in the United States who live in poverty, nearly half have low levels of literacy.  (3)  Children whose parents have low levels of literacy are more than 70 percent more likely to also have low levels of literacy and are more likely to get poor grades, display behavioral problems, have high absentee rates, repeat school years, or drop out.  (4)  The 2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress 4th Grade Reading Level Assessment showed the national average reading score for 2019 was lower than 2017.  (5)  More than 70 percent of State prison inmates have low levels of literacy.  (6)  Low levels of literacy are connected to over $230,000,000,000 a year in health care costs in the United States.  (7)  Dyslexia is thought to be the most common neurocognitive disorder, affecting about 10 percent of children in school.  (8)  In 1997, Congress asked the Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, to convene a national panel, the National Reading Panel, to assess the status of research-based knowledge, including the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching children to read. The report, released in 2000, documented overwhelming evidence that instruction in phonics enhances all students’ success in learning to read.   (9)  In 2014, in response to the Pennsylvania General Assembly’s passage of Act 69 of 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Education developed the Dyslexia Screening and Early Literacy Intervention Pilot Program, which established a three-year early literacy intervention and dyslexia pilot program using evidence-based screening and then evidence-based instruction and intervention for students found to be at risk for future reading difficulties. Such Program identified students in kindergarten who were deemed at risk for reading difficulties, including dyslexia, using screening tests.   (10)  Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and South Carolina have all commissioned task forces on early literacy or dyslexia.   (11)  Arkansas, Arizona, Oregon, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Wyoming have put into place protocols and procedures to screen for early reading deficiencies and dyslexia.  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of the Congress that—  (1)  it is in the interest of the Nation to ensure all children in the United States, regardless of ability, disability, or circumstance, be afforded a high-quality education that includes the promotion of literacy skills; and  (2) the Individual with Disabilities Education Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1400  et seq.) should be robustly funded.
 3.  Definitions  For the purposes of the pilot program authorized by this Act:  (1)  Dyslexia The term  dyslexia  means a condition that— (A)  is characterized by difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities that typically results from a deficit in one or more processes related to the phonological component of language;  (B)  is often unrelated to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction; and  (C)  may result in problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that may impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.   (2)  Comprehensive literacy instruction The term  comprehensive literacy instruction  has the meaning given such term in section 2221(b) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 6641(b) ). (3)  Intensive intervention  (A)  In general The term  intensive intervention  means a structured literacy program that includes explicit, multisensory, and systematic phonics instruction and is delivered in the manner proscribed by the developer of the structured literacy program by a teacher trained in such program. (B)  Phonics instruction terms  With respect to phonics instruction that is part of intensive intervention—  (i) the term  explicit  means instruction in which a teacher clearly explains and models key skills, with well-chosen examples, and students are not expected to develop the skills based mainly on exposure and incidental learning opportunities; (ii) the term  multisensory  means instruction that combines listening, speaking, reading, and a tactile or kinesthetic activity; and (iii) the term  systematic  means instruction that is planned and provided in specific sequence, with important prerequisite skills taught before more advanced skills, and with care taken not to introduce skills in a way that is confusing to students. (4)  Local educational agency The term  local educational agency  has the meaning given such term in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 7801 ). (5)  Secretary The term  Secretary  means the Secretary of Education.  (6)  State educational agency The term  State educational agency  has the meaning given such term in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 7801 ).

(2) Three times during each school year during the grant period, including at the beginning of the school year, during the middle of the school year, and during the final academic period of the school year, use evidence-based methods of screening identified in accordance with  subsection (d)(3)  to screen each student in kindergarten through grade 3 enrolled in each participating local educational agency in the State for low phonemic awareness and other evidence-based risk factors for early reading deficiencies and dyslexia.  (3) For each student who is suspected of having an early reading deficiency or dyslexia, or both, based on the results of a screening conducted in accordance with  paragraph (2) — (A)  notify the parent or guardian of such student that the student was screened, the results of the student’s screening, and that the student is eligible to receive reading intervention services as part of the Pilot Program;  (B)  provide to the parent or guardian of such student information about additional screening and services available through the Pilot Program, and information on other resources available through the local educational agency and State to parents and students about early reading deficiencies and dyslexia, and recommended evidence-based resources and interventions; and  (C)  in order to provide additional screening, diagnostic assessments, or services to the student under the Pilot Program, require consent from the parent or guardian of such student indicating that the parent or guardian voluntarily and knowingly consents to the continued participation of the student in the Pilot Program.  (4)  For each student suspected of having an early reading deficiency or dyslexia based on the results of a screening whose parent or guardian has consented to continued participation in the Pilot Program—  (A)  conduct diagnostic assessments that—  (i)  are nationally standardized, norm-referenced screening assessments of phonological awareness, alphabetic knowledge, concept of word and grapheme phoneme correspondence; and  (ii)  are proven to have predictive validity and classification accuracy; and  (B) provide intensive intervention identified in accordance with  subsection (d)(4)  in areas identified by the screening, diagnostic assessments, or progress monitoring data collected by intervention teachers, that includes timely targeted instruction and strategic reteaching of specific unlearned material or concepts until mastery is achieved.
