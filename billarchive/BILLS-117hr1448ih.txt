 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act  or the  PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) According to the analyses of veteran suicide published by the Department of Veterans Affairs in August 2016 and titled  Suicide Among Veterans and Other Americans , and in June 2018, titled  VA National Suicide Date Report — (A)  an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each day in 2014;  (B)  mental health disorders, including major depression and other mood disorders, have been associated with increased risk for suicide;  (C)  since 2001, the proportion of users of the Veterans Health Administration with mental health conditions or substance use disorders has increased from approximately 27 percent in 2001 to more than 40 percent in 2014; and  (D)  overall, suicide rates are highest among patients with mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses who are in treatment and lower among those who received a mental health diagnosis but were not at risk enough to require enhanced care from a mental health provider.  (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs must be more effective in its approach to reducing the burden of veteran suicide connected to mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (in this section referred to as  PTSD ), and new, rigorous scientific research provides persuasive weight to the growing anecdotal evidence that service dogs ameliorate the symptoms associated with PTSD, and in particular, help prevent veteran suicide. (3)  Several organizations have proven track records of training service dogs for veterans with severe PTSD and dramatically improving those veterans’ quality of life, ability to re-enter society, and, most importantly, their chances of survival.
