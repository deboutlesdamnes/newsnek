 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Guardianship Accountability Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings; purposes  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  An estimated 1,300,000 adults and approximately $50,000,000,000 in assets are under the care of guardians in the United States.  (2)  Most guardians are selfless, dedicated individuals who play an important role in safeguarding individuals in need of support. However, unscrupulous guardians acting with little oversight have used guardianship proceedings to obtain control of individuals in need of support.  (3)  Once a guardianship is imposed, there are often few safeguards in place to protect against individuals who choose to abuse the system and few states are able to report accurate or detailed guardianship data.  (4)  A full guardianship order may remove more rights than necessary and thus may not be the best means of providing support and protection to an individual. If individuals subject to guardianship regain capacity, all or some rights should be quickly and efficiently restored.  (5)  States should encourage courts to use alternatives to guardianship through State statutes, including the adoption of the Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrangements Act, to ensure better protections and control for individuals being considered for guardianship and those pursuing a restoration of their rights.  (6)  A national resource center on guardianship is needed to collect and publish information for the benefit of courts, policy makers, individuals subject to guardianship, guardians, community organizations, and other stakeholders.  (b)  Purposes  The purposes of this Act are to help States improve guardianship oversight and data collection by—  (1)  designating a National Resource Center on Guardianship;  (2)  authorizing grants for the purpose of developing State Guardianship Databases; and  (3)  establishing procedures for sharing background check information related to appointed guardians with other jurisdictions.

(2)  Individuals subject to guardianship The term  individuals subject to guardianship  means any individual 18 years or older placed under a guardianship.
