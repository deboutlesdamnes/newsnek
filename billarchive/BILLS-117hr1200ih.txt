
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Stop Corporations and High Earners from Avoiding Taxes and Enforce the Rules Strictly Act  or the  Stop CHEATERS Act . 
  2.  Policy of Congress  It is the policy of Congress that— 
 (1)  tax compliance, to raise revenue for national needs, restore fairness, and protect the integrity of the tax system, high-income United States citizens and corporations should pay all of the taxes they owe,   (2)  tax compliance, as indicated by the fraction of taxes due that are reported and paid, should be comparable among groups of taxpayers regardless of the legal entity,  
 (3)  the Internal Revenue Service should be given resources to increase audits and enforcement of tax compliance of high-income individuals to reduce the tax gap, with an emphasis on the auditing and enforcement of tax compliance by individuals with gross income of not less than $1,000,000 and of large corporations, and to modernize its technology in order to better serve taxpayers and enforce the tax laws,   (4)  pursuing non-filers is one of the most efficient enforcement strategies of the Internal Revenue Service because issuing non-filer notices can be a cost-effective tool that requires little more than automated notices, 
 (5)  priorities for actions and resources to improve compliance should be guided by the relative revenue loss from non-compliance,    (6)  it should be the goal of the Internal Revenue Service that, by the tenth tax year after the effective date of this statute, the net tax gap, as measured by the fraction of taxes that are due that are not reported and paid, should be reduced by at least one-third, as compared with the fraction estimated in the most recent Internal Revenue Service study prior to enactment of this statute, and 
 (7)  it should be the goal of the Internal Revenue Service to provide quality, timely, and accurate assistance to all taxpayers interacting with the Internal Revenue Service.
