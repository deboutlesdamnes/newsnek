 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Improving Access to Nutrition Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  The Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  35 million people, including over 10 million children, suffered from hunger even before the COVID-19 pandemic.  (2)  Analyses show that 50 million people, including 17 million children, could go hungry due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  (3)  As of December 2020, food insecurity among White households with children was 24.2 percent, while 38.6 percent of Latinx and 40.6 percent of African-American households with children suffered from food insecurity.  (4)  Black and Hispanic children were twice as likely to live in households without enough to eat as White children, entering this crisis at disproportionate risk of going hungry.  (5)  Adults who identify as American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or as multiracial, were twice as likely as White adults to report that their household did not get enough to eat. While official national data for Native American households is lacking, previous research in Washington State showed food insecurity among Native households was 2.5 times higher than in White households.  (6)  The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened longstanding racial disparities and food insecurity.  (7)  SNAP is the Nation’s first line of defense against hunger and is especially vital for vulnerable populations. More than 85 percent of all SNAP benefits go to households with children, seniors, and persons with disabilities.  (8)  SNAP helps restore access to healthy food, improves overall health, and reduces poverty. SNAP participation is also associated with educational advancement of children in poverty and improvements in math and reading scores.  (9)  SNAP has a proven record of effectiveness in promoting food security and health as well as in providing economic stimulus. Each $1 in SNAP benefits during a downturn generates between $1.50 and $1.80 in economic activity.  (10)  Studies have also demonstrated that work requirements do not reduce poverty.  (11)  About 6.1 million individuals are subject to SNAP work requirements and are at risk of losing critical food assistance if they cannot comply.  (12)  Some live in households with school-aged children where benefit reductions or terminations could jeopardize children’s health, development, and future success.  (13)  Children in poverty also often depend on pooled resources (including SNAP benefits) from extended family members who do not claim them as dependents.  (14)  Studies show that health impediments are a primary cause of why many SNAP recipients are unable to meet a work requirement.  (15)  Work requirements also cause an increase in the administrative bureaucracy, which some studies have shown, cause a significant reduction in SNAP participation.  (16)  Studies show that Black Americans are particularly vulnerable and are most likely to face recent unemployment and work requirements would disproportionately prevent Black people from having access to this important benefit.  (17)  Families experiencing homelessness are most likely to leave programs like SNAP when there is a work requirement, thereby increasing their vulnerability.  (18)  COVID-19 has made people more vulnerable. A work requirement would serve to only further burden those most at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.
