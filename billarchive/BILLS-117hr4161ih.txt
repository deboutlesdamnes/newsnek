(2)  Eligibility determination  To be eligible for waiver under this subsection for a project, an applicant shall—  (A)  exhaust any amounts available through warranties on the applicable building or structure for the proposed noise mitigation activities; and  (B)  demonstrate that a State-certified building inspector conducted an inspection of the building or other structure and determined that—  (i)  the noise mitigation for which Federal assistance was previously provided is degraded or ineffective, or the manner of installation of such mitigation has caused damage to the building or other structure; and  (ii)  the condition of noise mitigation improvement described in subparagraph (A) is not attributed to actions taken by an owner or occupant of the building or other structure.   .
