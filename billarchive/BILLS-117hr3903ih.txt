Ordinary income treatment in the case of partnership interests held in connection with performance of services  (a)  In general  Section 1061  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: 1061.  Partnership interests held in connection with performance of services  (a)  In general  If one or more applicable partnership interests are held by a taxpayer at any time during the taxable year, so much of—  (1)  the taxpayer’s net capital gain with respect to such interests for such taxable year, as does not exceed  (2)  the taxpayer’s recharacterization account balance for such taxable year,  shall be treated as ordinary income.   (b)  Net capital gain  (1)  In general  For purposes of subsection (a)(1), net capital gain shall be determined under section 1222, except that such section shall be applied—  (A)  without regard to the recharacterization of any item as ordinary income under this section,  (B)  by only taking into account items of gain and loss—  (i)  taken into account by the taxpayer under section 702 with respect to any applicable partnership interest,  (ii)  recognized by the taxpayer on the disposition of any such interest, or  (iii)  recognized by the taxpayer under paragraph (4) on a distribution of property with respect to such interest, and  (C)  in the case of a taxable year for which section 1231 gains (as defined in section 1231(a)(3)(A)) exceed section 1231 losses (as defined in section 1231(a)(3)(B)), by treating property which is taken into account in determining such gains and losses as capital assets held for more than 1 year.  (2)  Allocation to items of gain  The amount treated as ordinary income under subsection (a) shall be allocated ratably among the items of long-term capital gain taken into account in determining net capital gain under paragraph (1).  (3)  Recognition of gain on disposition of applicable partnership interests  Any gain on the disposition of any applicable partnership interest shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provision of this title.  (4)  Recognition of gain on distributions of partnership property  (A)  In general  In the case of any distribution of property by a partnership with respect to any applicable partnership interest, the partner receiving such property shall recognize gain equal to the excess (if any) of—  (i)  the fair market value of such property at the time of such distribution, over  (ii)  the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of such partner (determined without regard to subparagraph (B)).  (B)  Adjustment of basis  In the case of a distribution to which subparagraph (A) applies, the basis of the distributed property in the hands of the distributee partner shall be the amount determined under subparagraph (A)(i).

(2)  Annual recharacterization amount  For purposes of this subsection—  (A)  In general The term  annual recharacterization amount  means, with respect to any applicable partnership interest for any partnership taxable year, an amount equal to the product of— (i)  the specified rate determined under subparagraph (B) for the calendar year in which such taxable year begins, multiplied by  (ii)  the excess (if any) of—  (I)  an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the partnership’s aggregate invested capital for such taxable year, over  (II)  the specified capital contribution of the partner with respect to the applicable partnership interest for such taxable year.  If a taxpayer holds an applicable partnership interest for less than the entire taxable year, the amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be ratably reduced.   (B)  Specified rate For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term  specified rate  means, with respect to any calendar year, a percentage equal to— (i)  the Federal long-term rate determined under section 1274(d)(1) for the last month of the calendar year, plus  (ii)  10 percentage points.  (C)  Applicable percentage  (i)  In general The term  applicable percentage  means, with respect to any applicable partnership interest, the highest percentage of profits of the partnership that could be allocated with respect to such interest for the taxable year (consistent with the partnership agreement and assuming such facts and circumstances with respect to such taxable year as would result in such highest percentage). (ii)  Secretarial authority  The Secretary shall prescribe rules for the determination of the applicable percentage in cases in which the percentage of profits of a partnership that are to be allocated with respect to an applicable partnership interest varies on the basis of the aggregate amount of such profits. Such rules may provide a percentage which may be used in lieu of the highest percentage determined under clause (i) in cases where such other percentage is consistent with the purposes of this section.  (D)  Aggregate invested capital  (i)  In general The term  aggregate invested capital  means, with respect to any taxable year, the average daily amount of invested capital of the partnership for such taxable year. (ii)  Invested capital The term  invested capital  means, with respect to any partnership as of any day, the total cumulative value, determined at the time of contribution, of all money or other property contributed to the partnership on or before such day.

(E)  Specified capital contribution  (i)  In general The term  specified capital contribution  means, with respect to any applicable partnership interest for any taxable year, the average daily amount of contributed capital with respect to such interest for such year.

(iii)  Treatment of related party borrowings Any amount borrowed directly or indirectly from the partnership or any other partner of the partnership or any person related to such other partner or such partnership shall not be taken into account under this subparagraph. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a person shall be treated as related to another person if the relationship between such persons would be described in section 267(b) or 707(b) if such sections and section 267(f) were applied by substituting  10 percent  for  50 percent  each place it appears. (F)  Multiple interests  If at any time during a taxable year a taxpayer holds directly or indirectly more than 1 applicable partnership interest in a single partnership, such interests shall be treated as 1 applicable partnership interest for purposes of applying this paragraph.  (3)  Net ordinary income  For purposes of this subsection, the net ordinary income with respect to applicable partnership interests for any taxable year is the excess (if any) of—  (A)  the taxpayer’s distributive share of items of income and gain under section 702 with respect to applicable partnership interests for such taxable year (determined without regard to any items of gain taken into account in determining net capital gain under subsection (b)(1)), over  (B)  the taxpayer’s distributive share of items of deduction and loss under section 702 with respect to such interests for such taxable year (determined without regard to any items of loss taken into account in determining net capital gain under subsection (b)(1)).
