(2)  Exclusions  The overtime supplement described in paragraph (1) shall not be treated as part of basic pay for purposes not covered by that paragraph, including the purposes of calculating—  (A)  overtime pay, night pay, Sunday pay, or holiday pay under section 5542, 5545, or 5546;  (B)  locality-based comparability payments under section 5304 or special rate supplements under section 5305; or  (C)  cost-of-living allowances in nonforeign areas under section 5941.  (3)  Limitations  (A)  In general  During the control period described in subparagraph (B), the amount of the overtime supplement that is considered basic pay under paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) may not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the border patrol agent’s basic border patrol rate of pay by the percentage representing the agent’s career average of assigned overtime supplement percentages (including 0 percent for periods of time during which no overtime supplement was payable). That career average percentage is computed without regard to the effect of the limitation on premium pay under section 5547, but the premium pay limitation remains applicable in determining the dollar amount of any overtime supplement computed using the career average percentage.  (B)  Control period  For the purposes of applying subparagraph (A), the control period described in this subparagraph is the period that begins 3 years before the date a border patrol agent will meet age and service requirements associated with entitlement to an immediate annuity and continues throughout the remainder of the individual’s career as a border patrol agent.  (C)  Assigned overtime supplement percentages  For the purpose of applying subparagraph (A), a border patrol agent’s initial career average of assigned overtime supplement percentages is the average for the border patrol agent’s career (excluding any period of initial training prior to the agent’s first regular work assignment) prior to the beginning of the control period described in subparagraph (B). During such control period, the career average shall be recomputed at the end of each annual period (as described in subsection (b)(1)(A)). In computing such career average, any periods of service as a border patrol agent prior to the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016, shall be included, and the agent’s assigned overtime supplement during such periods shall be deemed to be 25 percent.  (4)  Annual leave payment  For the purpose of computing an agent’s lump-sum annual leave payment under section 5551 or 5552, the pay the agent is projected to receive shall include a deemed overtime supplement derived under this paragraph. Such overtime supplement shall be based on the lower of the agent’s actual overtime supplement percentage in effect at separation or the average percentage of the agent’s overtime supplement over the 26 full biweekly pay periods immediately preceding that separation, and shall not exceed the amount that is or would be payable under the premium pay limitation in section 5547.  ;  (6)  in subsection (f)—  (A) in the heading of such subsection, by striking  and substitution of hours  and inserting  during regular time; absences during scheduled overtime ; and (B)  by adding at the end the following:  (5)  Application  (A)  Limitation on substitution  Notwithstanding paragraph (1), scheduled overtime (as described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) or (3)(A)(ii) of subsection (b)) may not be substituted for leave without pay on a day when a border patrol agent has a full day of leave without pay.  (B)  Leave without pay  As provided in paragraphs (2)(A)(ii) and (3)(A)(ii) of subsection (b), a border patrol agent shall incur no scheduled overtime obligation on a day when the agent has a full day of leave without pay.  ; and  (7)  by adding at the end the following:  (h)  Alternative work schedules  (1)  In general  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section or section 6101, U.S. Customs and Border Protection may assign a border patrol agent an alternative work schedule as described in this subsection, subject to any regulations prescribed by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. No alternative work schedule may be established under subchapter II of chapter 61.  (2)  Level 2 border patrol agent  A border patrol agent receiving a level 2 border patrol rate of pay may, in lieu of the standard work schedule described in subsection (b)(3)(A), be assigned to an alternative work schedule under the following terms and conditions:  (A)  The alternative work schedule shall be a regular tour of duty consisting of 9 workdays per biweekly pay period, with—  (i)  8 workdays including 9 hours of regular time per workday and 1 additional hour of scheduled overtime for each day the agent performs work during regular time; and  (ii)  1 workday including 8 hours of regular time per workday and 2 additional hours of scheduled overtime when the agent performs work during such regular time.  (B)  Subparagraphs (B) through (H) of subsection (b)(3) shall continue to apply to an agent assigned to an alternative work schedule under this paragraph. References in this section to regular time under subsection (b)(3)(A)(i) and scheduled overtime under subsection (b)(3)(A)(ii) shall be deemed to be references to regular time and scheduled overtime described in subparagraph (A), respectively.  (3)  Basic border patrol agent  A border patrol agent receiving a basic border patrol rate of pay may, in lieu of the standard work schedule described in subsection (b)(4)(A), be assigned to an alternative work schedule that is a regular tour of duty consisting of 4 workdays per week with 10 hours of regular time per workday.  (4)  Sunday pay; premium pay  A border patrol agent assigned to an alternative work schedule under this subsection, may receive, as applicable—  (A)  Sunday pay for no more than 8 hours of regular time associated with a given Sunday, consistent with section 5546(a);  (B)  premium pay for work on a holiday for no more than 8 hours of regular time associated with a given holiday, consistent with section 5546(b); and  (C)  basic pay for all regular time hours that qualify for holiday time off pay when an agent is relieved or prevented from working during such regular time on a day designated as a holiday by Federal statute or Executive order.
