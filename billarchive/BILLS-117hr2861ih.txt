  499B.  Federal share; non-Federal share   (a)  Federal share   (1)  In general Subject to  paragraph (2) , the amount of the Federal share of a grant under this subpart shall be based on a formula, determined by the Secretary, that provides, for each eligible student in the State or Indian tribe, a per-student amount that is equal to 75 percent of—

(c)  Determining number of eligible students   (1)  In general  For purposes of subsection (a) and (b), the Secretary shall develop and implement a formula for accurately estimating the number of eligible students in a State or Indian tribe and for making adjustments based on the number of eligible students enrolled on less than a full-time basis and the associated tuition and fees charged to such students in proportion to the degree to which each such student is not attending on a full-time basis.

 (1)  in consultation with the State or tribe concerned, determine whether the actual number of eligible students in the State or Tribe for the year covered by the grant is greater than the estimated number of such students that was used to determine the amount of the grant; and   (2)  in the case of a determination under paragraph (1) that the actual number of eligible students in the State or Tribe is higher than such estimate, issue a supplementary grant payment to the State or tribe in an amount that ensures that the total amount of the grant funds received by the State or tribe under this subpart for the year covered by the grant accurately reflects the higher number of eligible students.
