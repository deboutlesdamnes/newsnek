 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Cultivating Opportunity and Recovery from the Pandemic through Service Act  or the  CORPS Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  The United States has a strong history of citizen response to national calls to service in order to help the Nation recover in times of crisis.  (2)  More than 80 years ago, the Nation rose to the challenge of the Great Depression with the creation of citizen service programs.  (3)  Millions of participants benefitted from paid employment and opportunities to develop their skills while constructing national parks and public lands infrastructure and producing cultural works still enjoyed today.  (4)  Founded in 1990, the Corporation for National and Community Service today coordinates national service by individuals in the United States across every State and territory, partnering with State-level commissions and supporting locally driven services in partnership with nongovernmental organizations and State governments.  (5)  National service programs provide public health, education, employment training, and nutrition services for which the Nation has a critical need in the current crisis.  (6) The signature programs of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which are the AmeriCorps State and National, AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps, AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America (referred to in this Act as  VISTA ), and National Senior Service Corps programs, can and should be expanded to meet current needs. (7)  The novel coronavirus pandemic has infected and killed individuals in every State and territory, causing more than 31,000,000 cases and 560,000 deaths so far.  (8)  In response, States, Tribal governments, and cities across the country have closed down businesses, schools, and public events, leading to dramatic swings in the economy.  (9)  Millions of people in the United States have filed for unemployment benefits since the start of the pandemic, with unemployment rates peaking at an unprecedented level.  (10)  More than 1 in every 10 adults in the United States has applied for unemployment insurance since the crisis began.  (11)  The pandemic and the associated economic consequences have disproportionately impacted people of color across many States.  (12)  To recover, the Nation needs meaningful employment opportunities, as well as a significant expansion of the human capital working to address community needs around public health, behavioral health, hunger, education, and conservation.  (13)  Experience has demonstrated the centrality of community participation in pandemic response, to overcome stigma and structural barriers and meet the full needs of all members of a diverse community.  (14)  As the Nation works to respond to and recover from the current twin challenges of a public health pandemic and an economic crisis, national service presents a unique opportunity for flexible, locally driven responses to meet State and local employment and recovery needs. 
 3.  Purposes  The purposes of this Act are—  (1)  to provide for annual growth in the number of participants, over 3 years, in national service programs that will provide services in response to the pandemic and economic crisis;  (2)  to ensure that participant allowances cover the reasonable cost of participation and provide participants with economic and educational opportunity;  (3)  to stabilize such national service programs during economic crisis, including by supporting adaptations to service models in light of the crisis; and  (4)  to support opportunities for all individuals in the United States to engage in service, including through the recruitment of increasingly diverse and representative participants.
