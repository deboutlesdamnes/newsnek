(e)  Limitation  The Secretary may not provide a rebate under the program established under subsection (b) to an owner or operator of a qualified entity for expenditures made by the owner or operator of the qualified entity for an energy efficient electrotechnology that is used to replace a fossil fuel-fired technology if the Secretary determines that such expenditures were necessary for the owner or operator to comply with Federal or State law.   (f)  Authorized amount of rebate  The amount of a rebate provided under this section shall be not less than 30 percent, and not more than 50 percent, of the overall cost of the energy efficient electrotechnology, including installation costs.
