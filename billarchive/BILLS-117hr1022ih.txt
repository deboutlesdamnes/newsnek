 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act of 2021  or the  PAWS Act of 2021 . 
 2.  Findings; sense of Congress  (a)  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) According to the analyses of veteran suicide published by the Department of Veterans Affairs in August 2016 entitled  Suicide Among Veterans and Other Americans  and in June 2018 entitled  VA National Suicide Date Report — (A)  an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each day during 2014;  (B)  mental health disorders, including major depression and other mood disorders, have been associated with increased risk for suicide;  (C)  the proportion of users of the Veterans Health Administration with mental health conditions or substance use disorders increased from approximately 27 percent in 2001 to more than 40 percent in 2014; and  (D)  overall, suicide rates are highest among patients with mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses who are in treatment and lower among those who received a mental health diagnoses but were not at risk enough to require enhanced care from a mental health provider.  (2)  Pairing a service dog with a veteran costs approximately $25,000, including training of the service dog as well as training of the veteran with the service dog and follow-up services and support.  (3)  Organizations like K9s For Warriors and other members of the Association of Service Dog Providers for Military Veterans have proven track-records of training service dogs for veterans with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and dramatically improving those veterans’ quality of life, ability to re-enter society, and, most importantly, their chances of survival.  (4)  New, rigorous scientific research provides persuasive weight to the growing anecdotal evidence that service dogs ameliorate the symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and in particular, help prevent veteran suicide.  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that the Department of Veterans Affairs must be more effective in its approach to reducing the burden of veteran suicide connected to mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 3.

(c)  Benefits To be provided using grant funds  An organization that receives a grant under subsection (a) shall use the grant to—  (1)  provide a service dog for each eligible veteran participating in the program;  (2)  for each service dog provided, to provide—  (A)  commercially available or government-guaranteed veterinary health insurance to maintain the health of the dog and keep the dog functioning in the prescribed role for the life of the dog; and  (B)  hardware, or repairs or replacements for hardware, that are clinically determined to be required by the dog to perform the tasks necessary to assist the veteran with the diagnosed disorder of the veteran; and  (3)  cover the cost of any travel expenses for the veteran to obtain the dog, calculated in the same manner as similar travel expenses provided pursuant to section 111 of title 38, United States Code.  (d)  Travel expenses for replacement dogs  If a veteran replaces a service dog provided pursuant to a grant under this section, the Secretary shall pay an additional amount for such the travel expenses, to be calculated in the same manner as similar travel expenses provided pursuant to section 111 of title 38, United States Code. Such payment shall be in addition to any other benefits the veteran receives for the first service dog provided under this section.  (e)  Eligible veterans  (1)  Initial eligibility  For purposes of this section, an eligible veteran is a veteran who—  (A)  is enrolled in the patient enrollment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs under section 1705 of title 38, United States Code;  (B)  has been treated and has completed an established evidence-based treatment for PTSD yet remains diagnosed with PTSD by a qualified health care provider, as rated on the post-traumatic stress disorder checklist (PCL–5);  (C)  the health care provider or clinical team of the Department of Veterans Affairs that is treating the veteran for such disorder determines, based upon medical judgment, that the veteran may potentially benefit from a service dog; and  (D)  agrees to successfully complete training provided by an eligible organization in conjunction with the receipt of a service dog.  (2)  Ongoing eligibility  To remain eligible to participate in the program, a veteran shall see the health care provider or clinical team of the Department of Veterans Affairs treating the veteran for such a disorder at least once every six months to determine, based on a clinical evaluation of efficacy, whether the veteran continues to benefit from a service dog.

Such report shall include an evaluation of the approach and methodology used for the program with respect to—  (A)  helping veterans with severe PTSD return to civilian life;  (B)  relevant metrics, including any reduction in metrics, including reduction in scores under the post-traumatic stress disorder checklist (PCL–5), improvement in psychosocial function, and therapeutic compliance; and  (C)  reducing the dependence of participants on prescription narcotics and psychotropic medication.
