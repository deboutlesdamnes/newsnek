
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 2021 .
  2.  Purpose; rules of construction   (a)  Purpose  The purpose of this Act is to improve the safety and security of Federal judges, including senior, recalled, or retired Federal judges, and their immediate family, to ensure Federal judges are able to administer justice fairly without fear of personal reprisal from individuals affected by the decisions they make in the course of carrying out their public duties. 
 (b)  Rules of construction 
 (1)  In general  Nothing in this Act shall be construed—   (A)  to prohibit, restrain, or limit— 
 (i)  the lawful investigation or reporting by the press of any unlawful activity or misconduct alleged to have been committed by an at-risk individual or their immediate family; or   (ii)  the reporting on an at-risk individual or their immediate family regarding matters of public concern; 
 (B)  to impair access to decisions and opinions from a Federal judge in the course of carrying out their public functions; or   (C)  to limit the publication or transfer of personally identifiable information that the at-risk individual or their immediate family member voluntarily publishes on the internet after the date of enactment of this Act. 
 (2)  Protection of personally identifiable information  This Act shall be broadly construed to favor the protection of the personally identifiable information of at-risk individuals and their immediate family. 
  3.  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1)  Members of the Federal judiciary perform the important function of interpreting our Constitution and administering justice in a fair and impartial manner.   (2) In recent years, partially as a result of the rise in the use of social media and online access to information, members of the Federal judiciary have been exposed to an increased number of personal threats in connection to their role. The ease of access to free or inexpensive sources of personally identifiable information has considerably lowered the effort required for malicious actors to discover where individuals live, where they spend leisure hours, and to find information about their family members. Such threats have included calling a judge a traitor with references to mass shootings and serial killings, calling for an  angry mob  to gather outside a judge’s home and, in reference to a United States courts of appeals judge, stating how easy it would be to  get them. 
 (3)  Between 2015 and 2019, threats and other inappropriate communications against Federal judges and other judiciary personnel increased from 926 in 2015 to approximately 4,449 in 2019.   (4)  Over the past decade, several members of the Federal judiciary have experienced acts of violence against themselves or a family member in connection to their Federal judiciary role, including the murder of the family of United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois Joan Lefkow in 2005. 
 (5)  On Sunday July 19, 2020, an assailant went to the home of Esther Salas, a judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, impersonating a package delivery driver, opening fire upon arrival, and killing Daniel Anderl, the 20-year-old only son of Judge Salas, and seriously wounding Mark Anderl, her husband.   (6)  In the aftermath of the recent tragedy that occurred to Judge Salas and in response to the continuous rise of threats against members of the Federal judiciary, there is an immediate need for enhanced security procedures and increased availability of tools to protect Federal judges and their families.
