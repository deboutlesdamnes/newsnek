 (1)  incidents of unruly passenger conduct pose substantial operational and safety risks to passenger air carrier (as defined in section 3(f)) personnel and passengers on board an aircraft;   (2)  the forcible restraint of unruly passengers, while sometimes necessary, should only occur as a last resort to ensure the safety of passenger air carrier personnel and passengers on board an aircraft; 
 (3)  individuals who perpetrate such incidents, especially those that require forcible restraint, should be held fully accountable under all applicable Federal and State laws;   (4)  particular caution and judgement should be exercised by passenger air carrier personnel when determining whether a situation requires the forcible restraint of an unruly minor passenger or passenger experiencing mental distress; 
 (5)  the Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with appropriate Federal Agencies, should provide guidance and establish procedures for passenger air carrier personnel to address incidents of unruly passenger conduct, including the procedures, equipment, and training requirements for passenger air carrier personnel to—   (A)  recognize and respond to an instance of an unruly passenger behavior in a manner that attempts to de-escalate a situation; 
 (B)  properly and safely, if necessary, restrain an unruly passenger;   (C)  appropriately differentiate between unruly conduct from an adult passenger, a minor passenger, and a passenger experiencing mental distress and respond accordingly; 
 (D)  facilitate the reporting of such incidents to appropriate law enforcement agencies;   (E)  communicate expectations of conduct to air carrier passengers; and 
 (F)  communicate the rights of air carrier passengers with respect to passenger conduct towards passenger air carrier personnel; and   (6)  each passenger air carrier should have the procedures, equipment, and training in place to comply with the Federal Aviation Administration’s guidance and requirements described in paragraph (5).
