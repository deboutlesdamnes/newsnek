(3)  Federal and State coordination  The Commission, in consultation with the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth, shall establish processes through the rulemaking under subsection (e) to—  (A)  permit a State to elect for the Commission to conduct statewide systems of competitive bidding on behalf of such State as part of, or in coordination with, national systems of competitive bidding;  (B)  assist States in conducting statewide systems of competitive bidding;  (C)  ensure that program funds awarded by the Commission and program funds awarded by the States are not used in the same areas; and  (D)  ensure that program funds and funds awarded through other Federal programs to expand broadband service with a download speed of at least 100 megabits per second, an upload speed of at least 100 megabits per second, and latency that is sufficiently low to allow multiple, simultaneous, real-time, interactive applications, are not used in the same areas.  (c)  Program requirements  (1)  Technology neutrality required  The entity administering a system of competitive bidding (either a State or the Commission) in making awards may not favor a project using any particular technology.  (2)  Gigabit performance funding  The Commission shall reserve 20 percent of the amounts to be awarded by the Commission under subsection (b)(1), and each State shall reserve 20 percent of the amounts distributed to such State under subsection (b)(2), for bidders committing (with respect to any particular project by such a bidder) to offer, not later than the date that is 4 years after the date on which funding is provided under this section for such project—  (A)  broadband service with a download speed of at least 1 gigabit per second, an upload speed of at least 1 gigabit per second, and latency that is sufficiently low to allow multiple, simultaneous, real-time, interactive applications; or  (B)  in the case of a project to provide broadband service to an unserved anchor institution, broadband service with a download speed of at least 10 gigabits per second per 1,000 users, an upload speed of at least 10 gigabits per second per 1,000 users, and latency that is sufficiently low to allow multiple, simultaneous, real-time, interactive applications.

(H)  Projects that would provide for the deployment of open-access broadband service networks.  (6)  Unserved areas and areas with low-tier or mid-tier service  In determining whether an area is an unserved area, an area with low-tier service, or an area with mid-tier service or whether an anchor institution is an unserved anchor institution for any system of competitive bidding authorized under this section, the Commission shall implement the following requirements through the rulemaking described in subsection (e):  (A)  Data for initial determination  To make an initial determination as to whether an area is an unserved area, an area with low-tier service, or an area with mid-tier service or whether an anchor institution is an unserved anchor institution, the Commission shall—  (i)  use the most accurate and granular data on the map created by the Commission under section 802(c)(1)(B);  (ii)  refine the data described in clause (i) by using—  (I)  other data on access to broadband service obtained or purchased by the Commission;  (II)  other publicly available data or information on access to broadband service; and  (III)  other publicly available data or information on State broadband service deployment programs; and  (iii)  not determine an area is not an unserved area, an area with low-tier service, or an area with mid-tier service, on the basis that one location within such area does not meet the definition of an unserved area, an area with low-tier service, or an area with mid-tier service.  (B)  Initial determination  The Commission shall make an initial determination of the areas that are unserved areas, areas with low-tier service, and areas with mid-tier service and which anchor institutions are unserved anchor institutions not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this section.  (C)  Challenge of determination  (i)  In general  The Commission shall provide for a process for challenging any initial determination regarding whether an area is an unserved area, an area with low-tier service, or an area with mid-tier service or whether an anchor institution is an unserved anchor institution that, at a minimum, provides not less than 45 days for a person to voluntarily submit information concerning—  (I)  the broadband service offered in the area, or a commitment to offer broadband service in the area that is subject to legal sanction if not performed; or  (II)  the broadband service offered to the anchor institution.  (ii)  Streamlined process  The Commission shall ensure that such process is sufficiently streamlined such that a reasonably prudent person may easily participate to challenge such initial determination with little burden on such person.  (D)  Final determination  The Commission shall make a final determination of the areas that are unserved areas, areas with low-tier service, or areas with mid-tier service and which anchor institutions are unserved anchor institutions within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this section.
