 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2021 .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Reporting abortion data has been voluntary in the past, which has not resulted in complete data being submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  (2)  While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requests specific data points from each State and the District of Columbia, there is a great variety in the information collected and published by the States.  (3)  In fact, there is not a single abortion data point publicly reported for all fifty States and the District of Columbia.  (4)  Even more alarming, three States that together account for 15 percent of the United States population of women of childbearing age do not report any abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  (5)  Accurate statistical data regarding abortion and those who survive abortion attempts is critical to public health and policy analysis. 
 3.  Medicaid payments for certain family planning services and supplies contingent on submission of abortion data to CDC Section 1903 of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396b ) is amended— (1) in subsection (a)(5), by inserting before  an amount equal to  the following:  subject to subsection (bb), ; and (2)  by adding at the end the following new subsection:  (bb)  Annual reports on abortion data  (1)  In general  Subject to paragraph (2), as a condition of receiving payment under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during a year (beginning with the year following two years after the date of the enactment of this subsection) for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in section 1902(ii) or an individual whose medical assistance under this title is limited to such services and supplies furnished pursuant to a waiver granted under section 1115, each State shall, by not later than December 31 of the previous year, submit to the abortion surveillance system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with respect to the year before the previous year, at least abortion data regarding the mandatory questions described in section 317U(a)(3)(A) of the Public Health Service Act.  (2)  Late submission of reports  With respect to a year, in the case of a State that does not submit by December 31 of the previous year the abortion data required under paragraph (1) with respect to the year before the previous year but submits such data by December 31 of the year, such State shall continue to receive payment, including retroactive payment, under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during the year for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in such paragraph.  (3)  Certification of abortion data  (A)  In general  With respect to each submission of abortion data under this subsection, a State shall certify to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that such data is accurate.  (B)  False information  In the case that the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines that a State has knowingly provided false information with respect to a submission of abortion data under this subsection, such State may not receive payment under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during the first full fiscal year following such determination for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in paragraph (1).  .
