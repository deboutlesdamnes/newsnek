 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Kyle H. Rittenhouse Congressional Gold Medal Act .
 2.  Findings  The Congress finds the following:  (1)  Throughout the summer of 2020, local governments across various cities and States failed to adequately protect residents and their property from violent riots that included arson, looting, and murder.  (2)  On August 25, 2020, a violent BLM riot broke out in Kenosha, Wisconsin, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk and leaving property vulnerable to destruction.  (3)  The courageous actions taken in response to the threat to his community by Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from the greater Kenosha area, went beyond the civilian call of duty.  (4)  Kyle Rittenhouse traveled to the site of the riot with a medical kit to provide aid to those injured by the rioters; he also carried a fire extinguisher to help put out fires at various properties started by arsonists.  (5)  Kyle Rittenhouse disarmed a pistol-wielding individual with a lengthy criminal record, including driving while intoxicated and carrying a firearm while intoxicated.  (6)  Corporate media outlets including CNN, MSNBC, and the Washington Post, and certain Members of Congress, unjustly attacked Kyle Rittenhouseâ€™s character before his eventual acquittal, a direct contradiction to the legal principle that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  (7) On November 19, 2021, Kyle Rittenhouse was found  not guilty  on all charges by a jury of his peers, rendering the slanderous and libelous content of the aforementioned corporate media and certain Members of Congress against him susceptible to charges of defamation.

(3)  Smithsonian institution  (A)  In general  One gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be available for display as appropriate and available for research.  (B)  Plaque  In displaying the gold medal given under subparagraph (A), the Smithsonian Institution shall display the medal with a plaque that denotes Kyle Rittenhouse as a defender of his community against the BLM riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 25, 2020.  (C)  Sense of the congress  It is the sense of the Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal given under subparagraph (A) available for display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations associated with the protection of American cities during the BLM riots of the summer of 2020. 
 4.

 5.  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of the Congress that the United States Mint should expedite production of the gold medals and duplicate medals under this Act, so that the heroic and protective actions of Kyle H. Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha can be recognized and honored in a timely manner. 
 6.  Status of medals  (a)  National medals The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for purposes of  chapter 51  of title 31, United States Code.
