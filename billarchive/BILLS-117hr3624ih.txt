
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Disaster Learning and Life Saving Act of 2021 .
  2.  Establishment and purpose   (a)  Organization  There is established in the executive branch a National Disaster Safety Board, which shall be an independent establishment, as defined in section 104 of title 5, United States Code. 
 (b)  Purpose  The purposes of the Board are—   (1)  to reduce loss of life, injury, and economic injury caused by future incidents by learning from natural hazards, including the impacts and underlying factors of such incidents, in a standardized way; 
 (2)  to maintain a focus that is future-looking and national in scope, by applying what the Board learns through the trends that emerge from the incidents the Board reviews nationally to prevent loss of life, or human or economic injury, not only in the affected jurisdiction, but nationally, as the Board determines relevant;   (3)  in carrying out reviews, analyses, and recommendations, not to be accusatory in nature and the Board shall not seek to find blame in any individual or organization, or second-guess any relevant authorities;  
 (4)  to address systemic causes behind the loss of life and human or economic injury in incidents, including by recommending the augmentation of resources available to entities responsible for managing incident consequences; and   (5)  while preventing economic injury as part of the mission of the Board, when relevant, to prioritize efforts that focus on lifesaving and injury prevention, especially in disproportionately impacted communities, as its work determines them to be.  

 3.  General authority 
 (a)  Authority To review 
 (1)  In general  Subject to subsection (b), the Board shall review and establish the facts, circumstances, and cause or probable cause of the loss of life, human injury, and economic injury due to a natural hazard with 10 or more fatalities or that meets the requirements described in paragraph (5) or (6) of subsection (b) that occurs after the date of enactment of this Act.   (2)  Due to a natural hazard incident defined For purposes of paragraph (1), the term  due to a natural hazard  means a fatality that, if not for the natural hazard incident, as the case may be, would not have occurred within the time frame of the incident, as defined by standards developed by the Board.
 (b)  Determination of whether incident warrants Board review  In carrying out subsection (a), the Board—   (1)  may begin the review of an incident, including by monitoring the natural hazard and collecting facts, before the total number of fatalities is known if the Board determines that the natural hazard incident has the potential to cause 10 or more fatalities at its onset, in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board; 
 (2)  may, by a two-thirds vote, decide that an incident that caused 10 or more fatalities does not require a review and shall issue a public statement explaining the determination;   (3)  may, by a majority vote, decide to review any natural hazard incident that occurs after the date of enactment of this Act upon request from a representative of an affected State, Tribal government, or unit of local government, regardless of the number of fatalities;  
 (4)  may, by a majority vote, decide to review any natural hazard incident that occurs after the date of enactment of this Act upon recommendation by the Office for the Protection of Disproportionately Impacted Communities of the Board, which the Office may make because of the incident’s impacts on populations that are socially, medically, or economically vulnerable, as decided by the Office;    (5)  may, by a majority vote, decide to review a natural hazard incident that occurs after the date of enactment of this Act if— 
 (A)  the Board determines that information may be gained by the review that will be useful in reducing systemic causes behind the loss of life and human or economic injury; and   (B)  the incident— 
 (i)  did not result in 10 or more fatalities; and   (ii)   (I)  could have resulted in a large number of fatalities if not for swift intervention or a shift in the course of events; or

 (bb)  significant human displacement; or   (cc)  a significant number of severe non-fatal injuries or cases of severe illness; and 
 (6) shall, by majority vote, determine whether each incident for which the President issues a major disaster declaration under section 401 of the Robert T.
