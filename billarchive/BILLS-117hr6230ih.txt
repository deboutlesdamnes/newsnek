 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  USA Batteries Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) The Superfund fee established in  Public Law 117–58  makes American manufacturing less competitive by imposing a tax on chemicals used in domestic battery production that is not levied on imported batteries.  (2)  America’s lead battery industry has a $23.6 billion domestic economic impact annually and creates more than 25,000 direct jobs in 38 States.   (3)  Lead batteries have a 99 percent recycling rate and are a truly sustainable energy storage technology.   (4)  Lead batteries are critical for many sectors, including defense, transportation, logistics, telecommunications, and energy generation.  (5)  Increased taxes on domestic production create a disadvantage for American manufacturers and reduce the global competitiveness of the domestic lead battery industry by increasing the costs of key raw materials. 
 3.  Elimination of lead oxide, antimony, and sulfuric acid as taxable chemicals under Superfund excise taxes The table in  section 4661(b)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by  Public Law 117–58 , is amended by striking the rows relating to lead oxide, antimony, and sulfuric acid.
