
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act .
  2.  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1) Under the previous Administration, the term  climate change  was intentionally stripped from the Agency’s 2018–2022 Strategic Plan, despite the mounting threat posed by climate change as a source of changing and increasing national disaster risks.  (2)  It is the general consensus of the global scientific community that— 
 (A)  the evidence of climate change is unequivocal;   (B)  anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of climate change; and 
 (C)  as a direct result of climate change, sea levels are rising and extreme weather events are becoming more commonplace and severe.   (3)  The last 7 years have been the warmest years on record since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began recording global air temperatures in 1895. 
 (4)  In 2020, there were a record total of 22 climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to affect the United States—amounting to 5 more disasters of such magnitude than each of the previous record years of 2011 and 2017.   (5)  It is the mission of FEMA to reduce the loss of life and property and protect our institutions from all hazards by leading and supporting the Nation in a comprehensive, risk-based emergency management program of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 
 (6)  It is detrimental to the mission of FEMA, and the Agency’s ability to follow its mandate, to explicitly or implicitly deny or ignore the existence of climate change or the implications of such on national security and national emergency management.   (7)  To fully and effectively carry out its mandate, FEMA must comprehensively assess and incorporate the current and future natural disaster risks and impacts posed by climate change throughout the Agency’s policies, plans, programs, strategies, and operations. 

 3.  Statements of intent and policy Section 101 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5121 ) is amended—  (1)  in subsection (b)— 
 (A) in paragraph (5) by striking  and  at the end;  (B)  in paragraph (6) by striking the period at the end and inserting a semicolon; and 
 (C)  by adding at the end the following:    (7)  integrating, to the greatest extent practicable, climate change adaptation planning and actions into the programs, policies, and operations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
 (8)  assisting State, local, volunteer, and private partners in preparing for and mitigating the risks posed by climate change as listed in subsection (c)(2), as well as any other climate change risks.  ; and   (2)  by adding at the end the following: 

 (c)  Climate change  It is the policy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to recognize that—   (1)  climate change is— 
 (A)  an irrefutable, multidimensional, and significant near and long-term threat to United States—   (i)  homeland security; 
 (ii)  national security; and   (iii)  national disaster risk; and 
 (B)  primarily caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; and   (2)  as a direct result of climate change, the United States faces the increased threat of— 
 (A)  changing, more frequent, and more severe extreme weather events;   (B)  rising natural hazard risk; 
 (C)  disruptions to or failure of critical infrastructure;   (D)  sea-level rise; 
 (E)  internal population displacement;   (F)  the spread of life-threatening diseases; 
 (G)  rising annual disaster costs; and   (H)  disproportionately high risks and impacts to low-income communities, communities of color, Tribal communities, and other frontline communities.  . 

 4.  Definitions Section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5122 ) is amended by adding at the end the following:   (13)  Climate change The term  climate change  means the long-term shifts in global and regional climate patterns, and associated phenomena, that are occurring primarily as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
 (14)  Sea-level rise The term  sea-level rise  means the local, regional, and global long-term trends in rising average sea levels that are occurring as a direct result of climate change and additional local factors such as land subsidence.  (15)  Extreme weather events The term  extreme weather events  means historically rare or severe natural disasters such as heat waves, droughts, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.
 (16)  Frontline community The term  frontline community  means a low-income community, community of color, or Tribal community that is disproportionately impacted or burdened by climate change and associated phenomena. . 
  5.  Inclusion of climate change in strategic plan   (a)  Current strategic plan  Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall revise the 2018–2022 Strategic Plan to— 
 (1) ensure the text of such plan explicitly mentions climate change, in accordance with the policy of FEMA in section 101 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5121 ), as amended by section 3; and  (2)  address the implications of climate change on homeland security and near- and long-term national disaster risk, including emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. 
 (b)  Future strategic plans  Any strategic plan subsequent to the 2018–2022 Strategic Plan developed by FEMA shall—   (1) explicitly mention climate change, in accordance with the policy of FEMA under section 101 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 5121 ), as amended by section 3; and
 (2)  address the implications of climate change on homeland security and near- and long-term national disaster risk, including emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation, drawing upon findings and recommendations, once available, from the Climate Change Subcommittee described in section 6 and the assessment of climate change risks and preparedness described in section 7.
