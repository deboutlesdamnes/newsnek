
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Healthy Maternity and Obstetric Medicine Act  or the  Healthy MOM Act .
  2.  Findings and purpose   (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1)  Pregnancy is a significant life event for millions of women in the United States each year.   (2)  For more than 30 years, our Nation, through the Medicaid program, has recognized that pregnant women need immediate access to affordable care, and has allowed women who meet income-eligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid coverage when they become pregnant. 
 (3) Congress recognized the central importance of maternity coverage by classifying maternity and newborn care as one of the ten essential health benefits that must now be covered on most individual and small group health insurance plans under section 1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( 42 U.S.C. 18022(b)(1) ).  (4) Congress has also recognized the significant challenge of maternal mortality and the need to eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes for pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths, and to improve health outcomes for both mothers and babies through passage of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018 ( Public Law 115–344 ).
 (5)  Access to comprehensive maternity coverage allows women to access important pregnancy-related care, which is demonstrated to improve health outcomes for women and newborns and reduce financial costs for both consumers and insurers.   (6)  Uninsured women, women with grandfathered and transitional health plans, self-funded student health plans, and catastrophic and high-deductible health plans may lack access to comprehensive and affordable maternity coverage. 
 (7)  Employer health plans that exclude dependent daughters from maternity coverage leave young women without coverage for their pregnancy, even though Federal law has long held that treating pregnancy differently than other conditions is sex-based discrimination.   (8)  A special enrollment period is especially important for young adults, who are at high risk for unintended pregnancies, yet young adults are frequently enrolled in catastrophic coverage, which often has fewer benefits, more restrictions, and higher deductibles. 
 (9)  This coverage would be an equalizer for communities of color. The maternal mortality rate varies drastically by race and ethnicity, and where a woman lives. The rising maternal mortality rate in the United States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high African-American maternal mortality rate, which is four times more than the rate for White women.   (10)  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 700 women die each year in the United States from pregnancy-related complications. Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women are about three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women. 
 (11)  Data demonstrates that 3 in 5 pregnancy related deaths could be prevented. Improving access to care is one way to help prevent deaths, regardless of race or ethnicity.   (12)  Timely maternity care improves the health of pregnant women, as well as birth outcomes and the health of babies throughout their lifetimes. Pregnancy-related maternal mortality is three to four times higher among women who receive no maternity care compared to women who do. Regular maternity care can detect or mitigate serious pregnancy-related health complications, including preeclampsia, placental abruption, complications from diabetes, complications from heart disease, and Graves’ disease, all of which can result in morbidity or mortality for the mother or newborn. 
 (13)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than half of all maternal deaths occur at delivery or in the first postpartum year, whereas just more than one-third of pregnancy-related or pregnancy-associated deaths occur while a person is still pregnant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid program on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the end of the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands.   (14)  Timely maternity care and adequate postpartum care can reduce short- and long-term health care costs. If a woman does not have access to affordable maternity care during her pregnancy, and she or her newborn experiences pregnancy complications that result in health problems after birth, their insurer may end up paying much higher costs than if the insurer had covered the woman’s maternity care during her pregnancy. Intensive maternity care can reduce hospital and neonatal intensive care unit admissions among infants, resulting in cost savings of $1,768 to $5,560 per birth. For women with high-risk pregnancies, intensive maternity care saves $1.37 for every $1 invested in maternity care. 
 (b)  Purpose The purpose of this Act is to protect the health of women and newborns by ensuring that all women eligible for coverage through the Exchanges established under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Public Law 111–148 ) and women eligible for other individual or group health plan coverage can access affordable health coverage during their pregnancy.
