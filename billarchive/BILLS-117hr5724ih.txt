 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, Hunger, and Health Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  hunger and food and nutrition insecurity are conditions that can be solved;  (2)  access to healthy food and good nutrition should be a fundamental priority of each individual who lives in a State;  (3)  more than 50 years have passed since the United States convened a White House conference to comprehensively address the issues of food, hunger, health, and nutrition in the United States;  (4)  more than 38,000,000 individuals live in households that face food insecurity, 12,600,000 of whom are children and 5,000,000 of whom are seniors and persons with disabilities or critical illnesses;  (5)  (A)  because of the COVID–19 pandemic, more than 42,000,000 individuals, including 13,000,000 children, are projected to experience food insecurity; and   (B) diet-related diseases greatly worsen outcomes from COVID–19, contributing to nearly  2/3  of all COVID–19 hospitalizations in the United States; (6)  (A)  the COVID–19 pandemic has disrupted global and local food supply chains, identifying the fragility and importance of the food system as a national security issue and making clear that a diverse local and regional food system is essential to the resilience of the United States; and   (B)  that issue has become entangled with the issues of hunger and food and nutrition insecurity;  (7)  (A)  the burdens of food insecurity are not distributed equally, as the burdens remain higher among racial and ethnic minority groups, in rural areas, and in the south and southeast;  (B)  households headed by Blacks and Hispanics face higher rates of food insecurity, at a rate of 21.2 percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, while the national average is 11.1 percent; and  (C)  the geographic distributions of food insecurity remain a serious concern, as rural communities represent 87 percent of the counties in the United States with the highest rates of overall food insecurity;  (8)  (A)  nutrition insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups and low-income, rural, and other underserved populations in the United States; and  (B)  in just over 10 years, type 2 diabetes rates have doubled for African-American children and increased 50 percent for Native-American children and Hispanic children between 10 and 19 years old;  (9)  conservative cost estimates show that the true cost of hunger and illness related to hunger and food and nutrition insecurity in the United States is at least $160,000,000,000 per year with respect to direct medical costs, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid, an amount that exceeds the annual budget of the Department of Agriculture;  (10)  hyper-consolidation in the food industry has led to a dramatic decline in the farmer’s share of the food dollar, fewer choices for consumers, and economic insecurity for rural communities, many of which are now considered food deserts;  (11)  (A)  better food and nutrition can save the United States billions of dollars in health care costs by preventing or delaying the progression to late-stage disease for tens of millions of individuals who live in a State and have chronic diseases;  (B)  the adverse social, physical, and psychological outcomes associated with food and nutrition insecurity are well documented, particularly in households with children, including higher rates of diabetes and hypertension, self-reported fair or poor health, maternal depression, behavioral problems and developmental delays in early life, and poor academic achievement;  (C)  those outcomes are not only detrimental to the health and well-being of individual children and families, but also negatively impact broader society; and  (D)  based on a combination of lower worker productivity, higher costs of public education, greater health care costs, and the cost associated with emergency food distribution, the economic burden associated with food insecurity has been estimated to be over $178,930,000,000 annually; and   (12)  a national discussion of the root causes and social determinants of hunger and food and nutrition insecurity, as well as identification of solutions to those epidemics, can lead to action to implement those solutions and to end hunger in the United States.
