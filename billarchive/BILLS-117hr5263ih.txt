
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Directed Energy Threat Emergency Response Act .
  2.  Findings; sense of Congress   (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following: 
 (1) Since at least 2016, United States Government personnel and their family members have reported anomalous health incidents at diplomatic missions across the world and in the United States, which are sometimes referred to as  Havana Syndrome .  (2)  Some of the anomalous health incidents have resulted in unexplained brain injuries, which have had permanent, life-altering effects that have disrupted lives and ended careers. 
 (3)  A panel of experts convened by the Bureau of Medical Services of the Department of State in July 2017 to review triage assessments of medically evaluated personnel from the United States Embassy in Havana came to a consensus that the findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a nonnatural source.   (4) A 2020 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that  many of the distinctive and acute signs, symptoms, and observations reported by [affected] employees are consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy  and that  directed pulsed RF energy [...] appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases .
 (5) According to the National Academy of Sciences report,  such a scenario raises grave concerns about a world with disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for causing harm to others .  (6)  The number and locations of these suspected attacks have expanded and, according to press reporting, there have been more than 130 possible cases that have been reported by United States personnel in Asia, in Europe, and in the Western Hemisphere, including within the United States. 
 (7)  The continuing and expanding scope of these suspected attacks is impacting the security and morale of United States personnel, especially those posted overseas.   (8)  The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons (including diplomatic agents) to which 180 countries are a party, protects diplomatic personnel from attacks on their persons, accommodations, or means of transport, and requires all state parties to punish and take measures to prevent such grave crimes. 
 (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that—   (1)  the threat to United States Government personnel from suspected attacks presenting as anomalous health incidents is a matter of urgent concern and deserving of the full attention of government; 
 (2)  personnel, dependents, and other appropriate individuals suffering anomalous health incidents from these suspected attacks deserve equitable, accessible, and high-quality medical assessment and care, regardless of their employing Government agency;   (3)  diagnoses and determinations to treat personnel, dependents, and other appropriate individuals experiencing symptoms consistent with such injuries should be made by experienced medical professionals and made available by the Federal Government; 
 (4)  any recriminations, retaliation, or punishment associated with personnel self-reporting symptoms is unacceptable and should be investigated by internal agency oversight mechanisms;   (5)  information sharing and interagency coordination is essential for the comprehensive investigation, attribution, and mitigation of these injuries; 
 (6)  the Administration should provide Congress and the public with timely and regular unclassified updates on the threat posed to United States Government personnel by the suspected causes of these injuries;   (7)  recent efforts by the Administration and among relevant agencies represent positive steps toward responding to the threat of anomalous health incidents, but more comprehensive measures must be taken to further assist victims, investigate and determine the cause of the injuries of such victims, and prevent future incidents; 
 (8)  establishing the source and cause of these anomalous health incidents must be a top priority for the United States Government and requires the full coordination of relevant agencies;   (9)  if investigations determine that the anomalous health incidents are the result of deliberate acts by individuals, entities, or foreign countries, the United States Government should recognize and respond to these incidents as hostile attacks; and 
 (10)  any actors found to have been targeting United States Government personnel should be publicly identified, as appropriate, and held accountable. 
  3.  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States— 
 (1)  to detect, deter, and punish any clandestine attacks that cause persistent injuries to United States personnel;   (2)  to provide appropriate assistance to United States personnel harmed by such attacks; 
 (3)  to hold responsible any persons, entities, or governments involved in ordering or carrying out such attacks, including through appropriate sanctions, criminal prosecutions, or other tools;   (4)  to prioritize research into effective countermeasures to help protect United States personnel from such attacks; and 
 (5)  to convey to foreign governments through official contact at the highest levels the gravity of United States concern about such suspected attacks and the seriousness of consequences that may follow for any actors found to be involved.
