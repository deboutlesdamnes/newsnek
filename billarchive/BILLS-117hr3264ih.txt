(2)  Requirements  (A)  Risk analysis of critical domains  The research under paragraph (1) shall include a risk analysis of each identified United States critical domain for economic security to determine the degree to which there exists a present or future threat to homeland security in the event of disruption, corruption, exploitation, or dysfunction to such domain. Such research shall consider, to the extent possible, the following:  (i)  The vulnerability and resilience of relevant supply chains.  (ii)  Foreign production, processing, and manufacturing methods.  (iii)  Influence of malign economic actors.  (iv)  Asset ownership.  (v)  Relationships within the supply chains of such domains.  (vi)  The degree to which the conditions referred to in clauses (i) through (v) would place such a domain at risk of disruption, corruption, exploitation, or dysfunction.

For each such high-risk domain, or element thereof, such research shall—  (i)  describe the underlying infrastructure and processes;  (ii)  analyze present and projected performance of industries that comprise or support such domain;  (iii)  examine the extent to which the supply chain of a product or service necessary to such domain is concentrated, either through a small number of sources, or if multiple sources are concentrated in one geographic area;  (iv)  examine the extent to which the demand for supplies of goods and services of such industries can be fulfilled by present and projected performance of other industries, identify strategies, plans, and potential barriers to expand the supplier industrial base, and identify the barriers to the participation of such other industries;  (v)  consider each such domain’s performance capacities in stable economic environments, adversarial supply conditions, and under crisis economic constraints;  (vi)  identify and define needs and requirements to establish supply resiliency within each such domain; and  (vii)  consider the effects of sector consolidation, including foreign consolidation, either through mergers or acquisitions, or due to recent geographic realignment, on such industries’ performances.  (3)  Consultation  In conducting the research under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2), the Secretary may consult with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and private sector stakeholders.  (4)  Publication  Beginning one year after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall publish a report containing information relating to the research under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2), including findings, evidence, analysis, and recommendations.
