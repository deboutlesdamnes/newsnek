 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act .
 2.  Findings  The Congress finds as follows:  (1)  The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of valuable information, and the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from being used in crimes.  (2)  The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by barring the Federal Government from requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops.  (3)  A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the Tiahrt Amendments dramatically increased gun trafficking to the criminal market.  (4)  A 2016 study from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health found that in 2008, 79 percent of all guns recovered by police from crime scenes belonged to someone other than the perpetrator—30 percent had been stolen.  (5)  Every year, more than 123,000 Americans are shot.  (6)  2020 was one of the deadliest years on record for the United States, with an estimated 19,300 people killed in firearm homicides or non-suicide related shootings, which is a 25-percent increase over 2019.  (7)  In 2019, 58.9 percent of firearm homicide victims were Black and 15.9 percent of firearm homicide victims were Hispanic.  (8)  In 2019, the National Tracing Center at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives processed 450,000 trace requests on firearms from Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  (9)  Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun trafficking makes our families and communities safer.  (10)  Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal guns.
