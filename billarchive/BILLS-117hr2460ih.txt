 (II)  has the same rate of interest as the joint consolidation loan (as of the date that is the day before such separate consolidation loan is made); and   (ii)  in order to discharge such individual borrower from any remaining obligation with respect to the percentage of the joint consolidation loan described in clause (i)(I)(bb)— 
 (I)  cancel the outstanding balance of interest and principal due on such percentage, in the case of such a loan held by the Secretary; and   (II)  through the holder of the loan, assume the obligation to repay the outstanding balance of interest and principal due on such percentage, in the case of such a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under part B; 
 (iii)  ensure that such individual borrower shall not be held liable for the repayment of the percentage of the joint consolidation loan that is not described in clause (i)(I)(bb);   (iv)  in a case in which a payment was made under section 455(m)(1)(A) on the joint consolidation loan during a period in which the individual borrower for whom such separate consolidation loan is being made was employed in a public service job described in section 455(m)(1)(B), treat such payment as if such payment were made on the separate consolidation loan; and 
 (v)  in a case in which a payment was made under an income contingent repayment plan or an income-based repayment plan described in subparagraph (D) or (E) of section 455(d)(1), respectively, on the joint consolidation loan, treat such payment as if such payment were made on such separate consolidation loan.   (C)  Application for separate direct consolidation loan   (i)  Joint application  Except as provided in clause (ii), to receive separate consolidation loans under this part, both individual borrowers in a married couple (or previously married couple) shall jointly apply under subparagraph (A). 
 (ii)  Separate application  An individual borrower in a married couple (or previously married couple) may apply for a separate consolidation loan under subparagraph (A) separately and without regard to whether or when the other individual borrower in the married couple (or previously married couple) applies under subparagraph (A), in a case in which—   (I)  the individual borrower has experienced from the other individual borrower—

 (II)  the individual borrower certifies, on a form approved by the Secretary, that such borrower is unable to reasonably reach or access the loan information of the other individual borrower; or   (III)  the Secretary determines that authorizing each individual borrower to apply separately under subparagraph (A) would be in the best fiscal interests of the Federal Government.  .
