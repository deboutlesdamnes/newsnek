 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Appalachian Regional Commission Relocation Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission, are each headquartered in their respective region.  (2)  Headquartering regional commissions within the region affected is a sensible approach to ensure that the commissions are housed in more affordable locations than the District of Columbia, thereby reducing administrative overhead and making the commissions closer and more accountable to the people the commissions were designed to serve. 
 3.  Headquarters of the Appalachian Regional Commission  (a)  In general  Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:  (g)  Headquarters  The headquarters of the Commission shall be located in the Appalachian region.  .  (b)  Implementation  (1)  In general  Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Cochairman of the Commission shall take such actions as may be necessary to carry out the amendment made in subsection (a).  (2)  Extension  The Federal Cochairman of the Commission may extend, by up to 180 days, the period for implementation specified in paragraph (1) if the Federal Cochairman submits to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate written notice of the need for the extension.
