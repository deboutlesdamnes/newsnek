 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  National Service Animals Memorial Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds that—  (1)  the National Service Animals Monument Corporation’s mission is to honor and recognize the broad scope of service animals, including working animals, through the creation of a memorial to educate the public of the contributions by service animals and the human-animal bond between service animals and their handlers, whether a person with a disability, a law enforcement officer, military personnel, or other handler;  (2)  formalized service animal work began in 1929 when the Eustice School in New Jersey established the first guide-dog school;  (3)  the purple poppy is the international symbol for the service and sacrifice of service animals;  (4)  on February 24 of each year, National Service Animals Day is celebrated in the United States and throughout the world;  (5)  service and working animals, such as dogs, horses, homing pigeons, donkeys, mules, dolphins, sea lions, and other animals, have worked alongside and supported humans throughout history and have created strong human-animal bonds, including—  (A)  during the Revolutionary War, horses served in combat carrying soldiers, as well as transporting the wounded and critical supplies;  (B)  during World War I and World War II—  (i)  homing pigeons served as critical messengers with tiny message capsules attached to their legs that were used to send communications that saved the lives of countless soldiers, resulting in many pigeons becoming the target of enemy fire; and  (ii)  donkeys and mules transported food, supplies, and wounded servicemembers; and   (C)  during the war in Afghanistan—  (i)  military working dogs safeguarded the lives of thousands of servicemen by clearing areas of improvised explosion devices; and  (ii)  in one example, Lucca, a German Shepherd-Belgian Malinois service dog, was employed by the United States Marine Corps for 6 years and trained to detect explosives, deploying twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan, supporting over 400 missions without a single human fatality, and ultimately sustaining an injury and amputation in 2012 due to an improvised explosive device while on patrol in Afghanistan;  (6)  the bonds formed between military personnel and law enforcement and their working dogs are so strong that they have risked their lives willingly to save the other;  (7)  the tasks that service dogs perform for persons with disabilities are essential activities of daily living, such as guiding people with visual impairments, signaling sounds for those who are deaf, retrieving items for people with mobility issues, alerting about impending cardiac episodes or seizures, turning on lights, providing stability for their owner while standing, and pressing elevator and accessibility buttons;  (8)  in addition to service animals’ help with functional tasks and missions, the human-animal bond provides handlers the ability to live independently, work confidently, and socialize freely;  (9)  shelter dogs can be trained as service animals;  (10)  service animals, such as horses and dogs—  (A)  support a variety of health and therapy services, including for people with autism, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder; and  (B)  specifically, can support servicemembers and veterans who experience traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder;  (11)  search and rescue dogs working with civilian or law enforcement handlers make United States communities and the Nation safer when they assist with the rescue of lost children, seniors, and other at-risk individuals, including in the event of natural or manmade disasters, for example—  (A)  service animals have supported search and rescue missions after terrorist attacks, including September 11 and the Oklahoma City bombing; and  (B)  service animals have supported local search and rescue missions involving lost children, such as—  (i)  the service dog Mercy, a bloodhound with the Lee County, Florida, Sheriff’s department, who tracked a 12-year-old girl for more than a half mile through thick woods after she went missing during Tropical Storm Elsa in July 2021; and  (ii)  the service dog Gandalf, trained by the South Carolina Search and Rescue Dog Association, who found a 12-year-old boy who had vanished from a campsite in the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina in March 2019;  (12)  the extraordinary abilities of service animals, including smell, sensing, hearing, eyesight, and empathy, make them uniquely capable of helping humans, including by assisting with the identification of illegal drugs, detecting an impending seizure, hearing a person buried beneath rubble, or seeing an expensive or vital tool dropped by a naval diver;  (13)  service animals provide well-documented value to human health, safety, and security; and  (14)  the National Service Animals Memorial will represent a place of pride, introspection, and education to pay tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by all service animals and their handlers throughout history.
