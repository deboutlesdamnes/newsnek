  2.  Recognizing that physicians need to be protected from abuses of the peer reviewed process   (a)  In general Section 402 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 ( 42 U.S.C. 11101 ;  Public Law 99â€“660 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

 (6)  Some peer reviewed decisions may be based on factors other than competence or professional conduct. The stated reason for a professional review action may not be the actual reason for the action, and the actual reason may not be apparent from the face of the action. The need to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in effective professional peer review must be balanced against the need to protect competent physicians from peer review decisions that are not based on professional competence or conduct.  .   (b)  Effective date  The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986.
