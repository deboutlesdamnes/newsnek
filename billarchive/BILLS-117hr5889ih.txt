(D)  Deficiencies  (i)  In general  In completing a review of a State program authorized under this section, if the Secretary finds deficiencies, the Secretary shall—  (I)  notify the State of the deficiencies;  (II)  direct the State to correct the deficiencies; and  (III)  require the State to report to the Secretary on progress made by not later than 180 days after the date on which the State receives notice under subclause (I).  (ii)  Substantial deficiencies  If the deficiencies are substantial, the Secretary shall—  (I)  disallow the reported electricity savings or natural gas savings that the Secretary determines are not credible due to deficiencies;  (II)  re-review the State program 2 years after the date on which the original review was completed; and  (III)  if substantial deficiencies remain uncorrected after the review provided for under subclause (II), revoke the authorization for the State to implement a State program under this section.   (6)  Calls for revision of State applications  As a condition of maintaining the authorization to implement a State program under this section, the Secretary may require the State to submit a revised application under paragraph (1) if the Secretary has—   (A)  established new or revised performance standards under subsection (c);  (B)  promulgated new or substantially revised measurement and verification procedures and standards under subsection (e); or  (C)  otherwise substantially revised the Federal program established under this section.  (h)  Information and reports  In accordance with section 13 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, the Secretary may require any retail electricity supplier, retail natural gas supplier, third-party efficiency provider, or any other entity that the Secretary determines appropriate, to provide any information the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out this section.  (i)  State law  Nothing in this section diminishes or qualifies any authority of a State or political subdivision of a State to adopt or enforce any law or regulation respecting electricity savings or natural gas savings, including any law or regulation establishing energy efficiency requirements that are more stringent than those under this section.  (j)  Sense of Congress regarding cost recovery, fixed cost recovery, and shareholder incentives  It is the sense of Congress that each State regulatory authority is encouraged to review the rules and regulations of the State regulatory authority to ensure that retail electric suppliers and retail natural gas suppliers under its jurisdiction can—  (1)  recover the direct costs of energy efficiency programs;  (2)  fully recover authorized fixed costs, including lost margins from lower annual sales due to energy efficiency programs; and  (3)  earn an incentive for shareholders if the energy efficiency standards are achieved.
