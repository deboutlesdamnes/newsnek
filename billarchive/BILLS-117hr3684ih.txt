(8)  Sense of Congress on prompt payment of DBE subcontractors  It is the sense of Congress that—  (A)  the Secretary of Transportation should take additional steps to ensure that recipients comply with section 26.29 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (the disadvantaged business enterprises prompt payment rule), or any corresponding regulation, in awarding federally funded transportation contracts under laws and regulations administered by the Secretary; and  (B)  such additional steps should include increasing the Department of Transportation’s ability to track and keep records of complaints and to make that information publicly available.

 .

(2)  Exception For purposes of paragraph (1), the term  otherwise related legally or financially  does not include a minority relationship or investment. (3)  International agreements  This subsection shall be applied in a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States under international agreements.  (o)  Rail trust fund  (1)  In general  (A)  Funding  Beginning on the date on which a rail trust fund is established, any amounts made available under subsections (a), (g), (h), (i), (j)(1), (k), and (l) shall be derived from such fund.   (B)  Rail trust fund defined In this subsection, the term  rail trust fund  means a trust fund established under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for making certain expenditures for the benefit of rail and for crediting certain taxes and penalties collected relating to rail. (2)  Sense of Committee on need for rail trust fund  The following is the sense of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives:  (A)  There is a discrepancy in historical Federal investment between highways, aviation, and intercity passenger rail. Between 1949 and 2017, the Federal Government invested more than $2 trillion in our nation’s highways and over $777 billion in aviation. The Federal Government has invested $96 billion in intercity passenger rail, beginning in 1971 with the creation of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. Intercity passenger rail Federal investment is only 12 percent of Federal aviation investment and less than 5 percent of Federal highway investment.   (B)  Congress has recognized the value and importance of a predictable, dedicated funding source through a trust fund for all other modes of transportation including for aviation, highways, transit, and waterways. The Highway Trust Fund was created in 1956. The Airport and Aviation Trust Fund was created in 1970. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund was created in 1978. Mass transit was added to the Highway Trust Fund in 1983. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was created in 1986. With regard to Federal transportation investment, only intercity passenger and freight rail do not have a predictable, dedicated funding source through a trust fund.   (C)  The Federal Railroad Administration has identified more than $300 billion worth of investment needed to develop both high-speed and higher speed intercity passenger rail corridors around the United States. In addition, a Federal Railroad Administration report from 2014 found that shortline and regional railroads need $7 billion of investment. The federally owned Northeast Corridor has a $40 billion state of good repair backlog.   (D)  A rail trust fund would provide a predictable, dedicated funding source to high-speed and intercity passenger rail projects and for the public benefits of shortline and regional railroad freight rail projects. A trust fund provides essential longer term funding certainty to allow the United States to develop quality intercity passenger rail service in corridors across the country, eliminate the state of good repair backlog on the Northeast Corridor, allow for accessible equipment and stations for passengers with disabilities, move more freight on rail, redevelop an American passenger rail car manufacturing base, create good paying, middle class jobs, and reduce our nation’s transportation carbon emissions.
