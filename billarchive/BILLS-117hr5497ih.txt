 3.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  Since 1988, the United States policy of principled engagement has fostered positive democratic reforms in Burma, with elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020, helping to bring about the partial transition to civilian rule and with the latter 2 elections resulting in resounding electoral victories for the National League for Democracy.  (2)  That democratic transition remained incomplete, with the military retaining significant power and independence from civilian control following the 2015 elections, including through control of 25 percent of parliamentary seats, a de facto veto over constitutional reform, authority over multiple government ministries, and the ability to operate with impunity and no civilian oversight.  (3)  Despite some improvements with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms beginning in 2010, and the establishment of a quasi-civilian government following credible elections in 2015, Burma’s military and civilian leaders have, since 2016, overseen an increase in restrictions to freedom of expression (including for members of the press), freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of religion or belief. In 2017, Burmese authorities oversaw a genocide against Rohingya, which caused almost 1,000,000 Rohingya to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh.  (4)  On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military conducted a coup d’état, declaring a year-long state of emergency and detaining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and dozens of other government officials and elected members of parliament, thus derailing Burma’s transition to democracy and disregarding the will of the people of Burma as expressed in the November 2020 elections, which were determined to be credible by international and national observers.   (5) Following the coup, some ousted members of parliament established the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which subsequently released the Federal Democracy Charter in March 2021 and established the National Unity Government in April 2021. In June 2021, the National Unity Government included ethnic minorities and women among its cabinet and released a policy paper outlining pledges to Rohingya and calling for  justice and reparations  for the community.  (6)  Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the Burmese military has—  (A)  used lethal force on peaceful protestors on multiple occasions, killing more than 1,100 people, including more than 50 children;   (B)  detained more than 4,000 peaceful protestors, participants in the Civil Disobedience Movement, labor leaders, government officials and elected members of parliament, members of the media, and others, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners;   (C)  issued laws and directives that could be used to further impede fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression (including for members of the press), freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of association; and  (D)  imposed restrictions on the internet and telecommunications.  (7)  More than 230,000 people have been internally displaced since the coup, while thousands of others have sought refuge in neighboring countries, and the Burmese military continues to block humanitarian assistance to populations in need. According to the World Health Organization, the military has carried out more than 250 attacks on health care entities since the coup and killed at least 18 health workers. Dozens more have been arbitrarily detained and hundreds have warrants out for their arrest. The military has continued such attacks even as they inhibit efforts to combat a devastating third wave of COVID–19. The brutality of the Burmese military was on full display on March 27, 2021, Armed Forces Day, when, after threatening on state television to shoot protesters in the head, security forces killed more than 150 people.  (8)  The coup represents a continuation of a long pattern of violent and anti-democratic behavior by the military that stretches back decades, with the military having previously taken over Burma in coups d’état in 1962 and 1988, and having ignored the results of the 1990 elections, and a long history of violently repressing protest movements, including killing and imprisoning thousands of peaceful protestors during pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988 and 2007.  (9)  The military also has a long history of violent repression of ethnic and religious minorities. On August 25, 2017, Burmese military and security forces launched a genocidal military campaign against Rohingya, resulting in a mass exodus of some 750,000 Rohingya from Burma’s Rakhine State into Bangladesh, where they remain. The Government of Burma has since taken no steps to improve conditions for Rohingya still in Rakhine State, who remain at high risk of genocide and other atrocities, or to create conditions conducive to the return of Rohingya refugees.  (10) The Burmese military has also engaged in renewed violence with other ethnic minority groups across the country. Since 2018, fighting between the Burmese military and the Arakan Army has displaced more than 220,000 people in Rakhine and Chin States, including more than 130,000 Rohingya confined to camps since 2012. The military has continued to commit atrocities in Kachin and Shan States that a 2019 report by Amnesty International described as  relentless and ruthless . Fighting in northern Burma has forced more than 100,000 people from their homes and into camps for internally displaced persons. The Government of Burma continues to heavily proscribe humanitarian and media access to conflict-affected populations across the country. (11)  With more than $500,000,000 in humanitarian assistance provided to Burma and Bangladesh in 2020 alone, the United States is the largest humanitarian donor to populations in need as a result of conflicts in Burma. In May 2021, the United States announced nearly $155,000,000 in additional humanitarian assistance to meet the urgent needs of Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh and people affected by ongoing violence in Burma’s Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, and Chin states. In August 2021, the United States provided $50,000,000 in critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma.  (12)  Both government- and military-initiated investigations into human rights abuses in Burma involving violence between ethnic minorities and Burmese security forces have failed to yield credible results or hold perpetrators accountable.  (13) In its report dated September 17, 2018, the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded, on reasonable grounds, that the factors allowing inference of  genocidal intent  are present with respect to the attacks against Rohingya in Rakhine State, and acts by Burmese security forces against Rohingya in Rakhine State and other ethnic minorities in Kachin and Shan States amount to  crimes against humanity  and  war crimes . The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar established by the United Nations Human Rights Council recommended that the United Nations Security Council  should ensure accountability for crimes under international law committed in Myanmar, preferably by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court or alternatively by creating an ad hoc international criminal tribunal . The Mission also recommended the imposition of targeted economic sanctions, including an arms embargo on Burma. (14) In a subsequent report dated August 5, 2019, the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar found that the Burmese military’s economic interests  enable its conduct  and that it benefits from and supports extractive industry businesses operating in conflict-affected areas in northern Burma, including natural resources, particularly oil and gas, minerals and gems and argued that  through controlling its own business empire, the Tatmadaw can evade the accountability and oversight that normally arise from civilian oversight of military budgets . The report called for the United Nations and individual governments to place targeted sanctions on all senior officials in the Burmese military as well as their economic interests, especially Myanma Economic Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation. (15)  On February 11, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14014 in response to the coup d’état, authorizing sanctions against the Burmese military, its economic interests, and other perpetrators of the coup.   (16)  Since the issuance of Executive Order 14014, the Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions with respect to—  (A)  multiple high-ranking individuals and their family members, including the Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese military, Min Aung Hlaing;   (B)  state-owned and military controlled companies, including Myanmar Ruby Enterprise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co., Ltd., and Cancri (Gems and Jewellery) Co., Ltd; and  (C)  other corporate entities and Burmese military entities, including the military regime’s State Administrative Council.   (17)  Pursuant to Executive Order 14014, the United States has also implemented new restrictions on exports and reexports to Burma.  (18)  On March 22, 2021, the United States designated Burma’s Chief of Police, Than Hlaing, and the Bureau of Special Operations commander, Lieutenant General Aung Soe, for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 14014. The United States further designated 2 army units, the 33rd and 77th Light Infantry Divisions, for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 14014, for being responsible for or complicit in, or having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by people in Burma.  (19)  On March 25, 2021, the United States designated 2 entities linked to the coup leaders, Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation Limited. Those entities are the 2 largest military holding companies in Burma, and all shares in those entities are held and managed by current or former members of Burmese military regiments or units, or organizations led by former members of such regiments or units.  (20)  On April 8, 2021, the United States designated Myanma Gems Enterprise, a Burmese state-owned entity that is responsible for all gemstone activities in Burma, for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 14014. Gemstones are a key economic resource for the Burmese military regime.  (21)  On May 17, 2021, the United States designated 16 individuals and one entity connected to Burma’s military regime, including 13 key members of the Burmese military and 3 adult children of previously designated Burmese military officials, for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 14014.  (22)  On July 2, 2021, the United States added the following 4 entities to the Entity List set forth in Supplement No. 4 to part 744 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, in response to the February 1, 2021, military coup in Burma:   (A)  King Royal Technologies Co., Ltd., a telecommunications company that provides satellite communications services in support of the Burmese military.   (B)  Wanbao Mining and its 2 subsidiaries, Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper, Ltd., and Myanmar Yang Tse Copper, Ltd., copper mining companies that have revenue-sharing agreements with Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited.  (23)  Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited was added to the Entity List in March 2021. Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited provides revenue for Burma’s Ministry of Defense, an entity responsible for the military coup that was also added to the Entity List in March 2021. Additionally, 3 of the newly added entities, Wanbao Mining and its 2 subsidiaries, have long been reportedly linked to abuses of labor rights and human rights.  (24)  On July 2, 2021, the United States designated 22 individuals connected to Burma’s military regime for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 14014. Among the individuals so designated were 7 key members of the Burmese military, which continues to repress the pro-democracy movement in the country and use lethal force against the people of Burma, including children and members of ethnic minority groups. The other 15 individuals are the spouses or adult children of previously designated senior Burmese military officials whose financial networks have contributed to military officials’ ill-gotten gains.
