
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act of 2021 .
  2.  Findings  Congress finds that— 
 (1)  environmental hazards causing adverse health outcomes have disproportionately affected environmental justice communities as a result of systemic injustices relating to factors that include race and income;   (2)  environmental justice communities have increased vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change and need significant investment to face current and future environmental hazards; 
 (3) the Federal Government has lacked a cohesive and consistent strategy to carry out the responsibilities of Federal agencies described in Executive Order 12898 ( 42 U.S.C. 4321  note; relating to Federal actions to address environmental justice in minority populations and low-income populations);  (4)  it is necessary that the Federal Government meaningfully engage environmental justice communities in the process of developing a robust strategy to address environmental justice, including high levels of review, input, and consent; 
 (5)  there is a lack of nationwide high-quality data relating to environmental justice concerns, such as socioeconomic factors, air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and public health, and a failure to update the existing data with adequate frequency;   (6)  there is no nationally consistent method to identify environmental justice communities based on the cumulative effects of socioeconomic factors, pollution burden, and public health; 
 (7)  a method described in paragraph (6) is needed to correct for racist and unjust practices leading to historical and current environmental injustices through the targeted investment in environmental justice communities of at least 40 percent of the funds provided for a clean energy transition and other related investments, including transportation infrastructure, housing infrastructure, and water quality infrastructure;   (8)  funds targeted for environmental justice communities should include set-asides for technical assistance and capacity building for environmental justice communities to access the funds; 
 (9)  particular oversight and care are necessary when investing in environmental justice communities to ensure that existing issues are not exacerbated and new issues are not created, particularly issues relating to pollution burden and the displacement of residents;   (10)  several States, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations have engaged in cumulative impact environmental justice mapping efforts that can serve as references for a Federal mapping effort; 
 (11) many environmental justice communities, such as communities in  Cancer Alley  in the State of Louisiana, have been clearly affected by extreme environmental hazards such that the communities—  (A)  are identifiable before the establishment of the tool under subsection (b) of section 5 and the completion of the data gap audit under subsection (d) of that section; and  
 (B)  should be eligible for programs targeted toward environmental justice communities that have faced extreme environmental hazards before the establishment of that tool and the completion of that audit;   (12)  in addition to investment in environmental justice communities, pollution reduction is essential to achieving equitable access to a healthy and clean environment and an equitable energy system; and 
 (13)  specific policy and permitting decisions and investments may rely on different combinations of data sets and indicators relating to environmental justice, and race alone may be considered a criterion when assessing the susceptibility of a community to environmental injustice.
