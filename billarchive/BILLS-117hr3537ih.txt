(c)  Selection  Not later than 120 days after the date of submission of an application for a grant under this section, the Secretary shall determine whether to award the grant, taking into consideration—  (1)  whether awarding such grant will support a research objective relating to expanding access to investigational drugs (as described in subsection (a)); and  (2)  whether awarding such a grant may have the effect of diminishing eligibility for, or impeding enrollment of, ongoing clinical investigations.  (d)  Use of funds  A participating entity may use funds received through the grant—  (1)  to pay the manufacturer or sponsor for the direct costs of such drug (as authorized under section 312.8(d) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)), if such costs are justified as part of peer review of the grant;  (2)  for the entity’s direct costs incurred in providing such drug consistent with the research mission of the grant; or  (3)  for the direct and indirect costs of the entity in conducting research with respect to the drug involved.  (e)  Definitions  In this section:  (1) The term  participating entity  means a participating clinical trial site or sites sponsored by a small business concern (as defined in section 3(a) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 632(a) ) that is the sponsor of a drug that is the subject of an investigational new drug application under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355(i) ). (2) The term  participating clinical trial  means a phase 3 clinical trial conducted pursuant to an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355(i) ) or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 262(a) ) to investigate a drug intended to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, or cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (3) The term  participating clinical trial site  means a nonprofit or public health care facility, or network of facilities, at which patients participating in a participating clinical trial receive an investigational drug through such trial.
 3.  HHS public-private partnership for rare neurodegenerative diseases  (a)  Establishment Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the  Secretary ) shall establish and implement a Public-Private Partnership for Neurodegenerative Diseases between the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and one or more eligible entities (to be known and referred to in this section as the  Partnership ) through cooperative agreements, contracts, or other appropriate instruments with such eligible entities, for the purpose of developing treatments for amytrophic lateral sclerosis and other rare neurodegenerative diseases. The Partnership shall— (1)  establish partnerships, consortia, and collaborations with other public and private entities and individuals with expertise in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other rare neurodegenerative diseases for the purposes described in this subsection;  (2)  focus on advancing regulatory science and scientific research that will support and accelerate the development and review of drugs for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other rare neurodegenerative diseases; and  (3)  foster the development of effective drugs that improve the lives of people that suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other rare neurodegenerative diseases.  (b)  Eligible entity In this section, the term  eligible entity  means an entity that— (1)  is—  (A) an institution of higher education (as such term is defined in section 1001 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1001 )) or a consortium of such institutions; or (B) an organization described in  section 501(c)(3)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under subsection (a) of such section; (2)  has experienced personnel and demonstrated connection to the patient population;  (3)  demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that the entity is capable of identifying and establishing collaborations between public and private entities and individuals with expertise in neurodegenerative diseases, including patients, in order to facilitate—  (A)  development and critical evaluation of tools, methods, and processes—  (i)  to characterize neurodegenerative diseases and their natural history;  (ii)  to identify drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases; and  (iii)  to increase efficiency, predictability, and productivity of clinical development of therapies, including advancement of rational therapeutic development and establishment of clinical trial networks; and  (B)  securing funding for the Partnership from Federal and non-Federal governmental sources, foundations, and private individuals; and  (4)  provides an assurance that the entity will not accept funding for a Partnership project from any organization that manufactures or distributes products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration unless the entity provides assurances in its agreement with the Secretary that the results of the project will not be influenced by any source of funding.  (c)  Gifts  (1)  In general The Partnership may solicit and accept gifts, grants, and other donations, establish accounts, and invest and expend funds in support of pre-competitive research and research associated with phase 3 clinical trials conducted with respect to investigational drugs that are the subjects of expanded access applications under section 561 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 360bbb ).
