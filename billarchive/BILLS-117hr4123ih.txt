(2)  Permitting health reimbursement arrangements to be used for the purchase of private insurance will increase the number of Americans with health insurance coverage by as many as 800,000.  (3)  Permitting health reimbursement arrangements to be used for the purchase of private insurance will significantly increase the number of Americans obtaining coverage in the individual market, leading to more choice, stability, innovation, and lower premiums.  (4)  The administration rule permitting health reimbursement arrangements to be used for the purchase of private insurance ensures that those with pre-existing conditions will not pay more for coverage by requiring workers within each class of employment to be offered the same coverage regardless of health status.
