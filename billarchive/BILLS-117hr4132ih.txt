 (2)  whether the implementation, compliance, administration, enforcement, imposition of unfunded mandates, or other costs of the major rule or set of major rules to the economy are not justified by the benefits to society within the United States produced by the expenditure of those costs;   (3)  whether the major rule or set of major rules has been rendered unnecessary or obsolete, taking into consideration the length of time since the major rule or set of major rules was made and the degree to which technology, economic conditions, market practices, or other relevant factors have changed in the subject area affected by the major rule or set of major rules;  
 (4)  whether the major rule or set of major rules has become unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances;    (5)  whether the major rule or set of major rules is compatible with other regulations and not duplicative or inappropriately burdensome in the aggregate; 
 (6)  whether the major rule or set of major rules is ineffective at achieving the purposes of the major rule or set of major rules;   (7)  whether the major rule or set of major rules is duplicative of other Federal regulations; 
 (8)  whether the major rule or set of major rules has excessive compliance costs, user fees, imposes unfunded mandates, or is otherwise excessively burdensome, as compared to alternatives that—   (A)  specify performance objectives rather than conduct or manners of compliance; 
 (B)  establish economic incentives to encourage desired behavior;   (C)  provide information upon which choices can be made by the public; 
 (D)  incorporate other innovative alternatives rather than agency actions that specify conduct or manners of compliance; or   (E)  could in other ways substantially lower costs without significantly undermining effectiveness;

 (11)  whether or not the major rule or set of major rules limits or prevents an agency from applying new or emerging technologies to improve efficiency and effectiveness of government;   (12)  whether the major rule or set of major rules harms wage growth, including wage growth for minimum wage and part-time workers;

 (15)  whether, and the extent to which, the repeal, in whole or in part, of the major rule or set of major rules would impact public health;    (16)  the review of the report submitted by the Comptroller General of the United States under subsection (a)(2); and
