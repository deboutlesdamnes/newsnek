
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Clean Cooking Support Act .
  2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings: 
 (1)  Almost 3,000,000,000 people, representing more than one-third of the global population, rely on open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves using wood, charcoal, kerosene, agricultural waste, animal dung, coal, or other fuels. The majority of people using these types of cookstoves and fuels are in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.   (2)  Smoke from the use of traditional cookstoves and open fires contribute to household air pollution that causes illnesses that disproportionately affect women and young children. Such illnesses include low birth weight, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and other respiratory illnesses. 
 (3)  The household air pollution caused by traditional cookstoves and open fires claims 4,000,000 premature deaths annually, including 400,000 children younger than 5 years of age, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Household air pollution does not remain in the home and contributes to more than 10 percent of global ambient air pollution. In some countries, such as Nepal, household air pollution contributes to more than 30 percent of ambient air pollution. In 2019, more than 600,000 deaths were attributed to ambient air pollution stemming from the household combustion of solid fuels.   (4) According to the World Health Organization, the large-scale use of wood, charcoal, and kerosene for traditional cooking fuel accounts for 1.5–3.0 percent of global CO 2  emissions, which is a significant contributor to air pollution.

 3.  Statement of policy  It is the policy of the United States to reduce the adverse effects of household energy use in its foreign assistance programs and activities, as appropriate, including through—   (1)  applied research and development to improve design, lower costs, promote technology adoption, conduct health research and evaluation, and develop global industry standards and testing protocols for cookstoves and fuels to help ensure minimum standards for efficiency and emissions to lower health and environmental impacts; 
 (2)  diplomatic engagement to encourage a commercial market for clean cookstoves and fuels, reduce trade barriers, promote consumer awareness, improve access to large-scale carbon financing and other investment, and foster women-owned businesses along the entire business value chain;   (3)  international development projects to help build commercial businesses to manufacture, market, distribute, sell, and service clean cookstoves and fuels; 
 (4)  development efforts related to refugee camps, disaster relief, and long-term humanitarian and empowerment programs aimed at assisting women, girls, and other vulnerable populations;   (5)  financing or insurance to support projects that provide access to clean, affordable energy and energy savings through the manufacture, sale, and purchase of clean cookstoves and fuels; 
 (6)  dissemination of cookstove standards to lower environmental and health impacts associated with cook stoves through the International Organization for Standardization process for household, institutional, or commercial use; and   (7)  political engagement with low-to-middle-income countries to include cookstove and household energy emission reduction goals in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), guidance on implementation of the NDCs, and monitoring and verification frameworks. 

 4.  Clean Cooking Interagency Working Group 
 (a)  Establishment Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall jointly establish the Clean Cooking Interagency Working Group (referred to in this section as the  Working Group ), consisting of representatives from the Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, and any other Federal agency that the Secretary and the Administrator may designate to assist with overseeing the planning, management, and coordination of initiatives to increase the number of clean cookstoves and fuels worldwide.  (b)  Responsibilities  The Working Group shall— 
 (1)  establish goals and priorities for increasing the number of clean cookstoves and fuels worldwide; and   (2)  provide for interagency coordination, including budget coordination, of activities under this Act.

(d)  Meetings  Members of the Working Group shall meet not later than 90 days after the Working Group is established pursuant to subsection (a), and quarterly thereafter, to carry out the responsibilities described in subsection (b). 

 5.  Clean cooking program 
 (a)  Department of State; United States Agency for International Development  The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall work with the Clean Cooking Alliance, founded in 2010—   (1)  to engage in a wide range of diplomatic activities, including with countries across the globe and with United States embassies abroad, to support activities of the Clean Cooking Alliance and the clean cookstoves and fuels sector; 
 (2)  to continue the clean cooking initiatives supported by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, an intergovernmental organization formed in 2012, to reduce emissions of climate pollutants;   (3)  to advance programs that support the adoption of affordable cookstoves that require less fuel to meet household energy needs and release fewer pollutants, as a means to improve health, reduce environmental degradation, mitigate climate change, foster economic growth, and empower women; and 
 (4)  to carry out other activities authorized under this Act.   (b)  Department of Energy  The Secretary of Energy shall work with the Clean Cooking Alliance— 
 (1)  to conduct research to spur development of low-cost, low-emission, high-efficiency cookstoves through research in areas such as combustion, heat transfer, and materials development;   (2)  to conduct research to spur development of low-emission, high-efficiency energy sources;
