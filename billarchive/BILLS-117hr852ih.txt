
 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  United States-Israel PTSD Collaborative Research Act .
  2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings: 
 (1)  The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a given year. In addition, that figure amounts to about 12 percent of Gulf War veterans and up to 30 percent of Vietnam veterans.   (2)  The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that among women veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 20 percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. 
 (3)  In the United States, it is thought that 70 percent of Americans have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and approximately 20 percent of those persons have struggled or continue to struggle with symptoms of PTSD.   (4)  Studies show that PTSD has links to homelessness and substance abuse in the United States. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that approximately 11 percent of the homeless population are veterans and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that about 7 percent of veterans have a substance abuse disorder. 
 (5)  Our ally Israel, under constant attack from terrorist groups, experiences similar issues with Israeli veterans facing PTSD symptoms. Tel Aviv University’s National Center for Traumatic Stress and Resilience found that 5 to 8 percent of combat soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and during wartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 percent.   (6)  Current treatment options in the United States focus on cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, but the United States must continue to look for more effective treatments. Several leading Israeli hospitals, academic institutions, and nonprofits dedicate research and services to treating PTSD.

Such gifts of money accepted under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury in the Department of Defense General Gift Fund and shall be available, subject to appropriation, without fiscal year limitation. 
 (g)  Reports  Not later than 180 days after the date on which an eligible entity completes a research project using a grant under this section, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that contains—   (1)  a description of how the eligible entity used the grant; and 
 (2)  an evaluation of the level of success of the research project.   (h)  Termination  The authority to award grants under this section shall terminate on the date that is 7 years after the date on which the first such grant is awarded.
