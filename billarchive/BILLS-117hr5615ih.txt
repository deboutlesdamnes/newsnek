(b)  Survey  In developing the plan required under subsection (a), the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall, to ascertain the scope of Federal assistance required, survey urban areas that—  (1)  did not receive grant funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative under section 2003 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in the current fiscal year concerning homeland security capabilities related to preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to acts of terrorism that had been developed or otherwise supported through funding under such Initiative that are at risk of being reduced or eliminated without such Federal assistance;  (2)  received such funding in the current fiscal year, but did not receive such funding in at least one fiscal year in the six fiscal years immediately preceding the current fiscal year; and  (3)  any other urban areas the Secretary determines appropriate.  (c)  Exemption The Secretary of Homeland Security may exempt the Federal Emergency Management Agency from the requirements of subchapter I of  chapter 35  of title 44, United States Code (commonly referred to as the  Paperwork Reduction Act ), for purposes of carrying out subsection (b) if the Secretary determines that complying with such requirements would delay the development of the plan required under subsection (a).
