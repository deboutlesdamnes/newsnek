(2)  Applications  In selecting entities to enter into contracts with under the pilot program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall ensure—  (A)  at least 1 entity selected will carry out a project that uses eligible hydrogen as a feedstock in an industrial application, such as synthesis of ammonia, fuels, or chemicals;  (B)  at least 1 entity selected will carry out a project that uses eligible hydrogen as a fuel in an industrial application;  (C)  at least 1 entity selected will carry out a project that uses eligible hydrogen as a fuel in a transportation application, including use at a transportation hub, such as a port, transit depot, or distribution center;  (D)  at least 1 entity selected will carry out a project that uses eligible hydrogen as a fuel in a power application;  (E)  not less than 2 entities selected will carry out a project that uses eligible hydrogen produced using electricity, or thermal energy, generated from zero-emission energy sources; and  (F)  each entity selected addresses any necessary hydrogen storage and infrastructure needs associated with the project, including by procuring those services from other entities.  (c)  Contract for differences  (1)  Payment  The Secretary shall provide at least one payment annually to an entity with which the Secretary has entered into a contract under the pilot program established under subsection (a).  (2)  Amount  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the amount of a payment, with respect to eligible hydrogen used by a project over a designated period of time, as determined by the Secretary, to an entity with which the Secretary has entered into a contract under the pilot program established under subsection (a) shall be—  (A)  with respect to an entity carrying out a project using eligible hydrogen produced using electricity, or thermal energy, generated from zero-emission energy sources, an amount equal to—  (i)  the cost of such eligible hydrogen that is produced or purchased, and then used by the project; minus  (ii)  the applicable fair market value, as determined by the Secretary, to produce or purchase an equal quantity of conventional hydrogen; or  (B)  with respect to an entity carrying out a project using any other type of eligible hydrogen, an amount equal to—  (i)  the number that is equal to—  (I)  the cost of such eligible hydrogen that is produced or purchased, and then used by the project; minus  (II)  the applicable fair market value, as determined by the Secretary, to produce or purchase an equal quantity of conventional hydrogen; multiplied by   (ii)  the number that is equal to—  (I)  1; minus  (II)  as determined by the Secretary, the number that is equal to—  (aa)  the quantity of the greenhouse gas emissions, on a life-cycle basis, associated with such eligible hydrogen that is used by the project; divided by  (bb)  the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions, on a life-cycle basis, associated with an equal quantity of conventional hydrogen.  (3)  Alternative amount calculation  With respect to an entity with which the Secretary has entered into a contract under the pilot program established under subsection (a) that will carry out a project that uses eligible hydrogen to displace a nonhydrogen fuel or feedstock, the Secretary may determine and apply a formula that is different than the otherwise applicable formula under paragraph (2) for calculating payments to such entity, taking into consideration the differences between the eligible hydrogen to be used in the project and the nonhydrogen fuel or feedstock being displaced with respect to—  (A)  cost;  (B)  emissions; and  (C)  heating value, as applicable.  (4)  Additional payment  To the extent appropriations are available, and notwithstanding subsection (d), the Secretary may provide a payment to an entity with which the Secretary has entered into a contract under the pilot program established under subsection (a) at the beginning of such contract—  (A)  that is additional to any other payment under this subsection;   (B)  that is not more than 50 percent of the expected total payments for the first year of the contract; and  (C)  for capital expenditures or procurement of services related to the project carried out by such entity, including equipment and infrastructure for storage, delivery, and distribution of eligible hydrogen.  (5)  Applicable fair market value  Before entering into a contract with an entity under the pilot program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall communicate to such entity the expected dollar amount of, and method for calculating, the applicable fair market value of conventional hydrogen or a relevant displaced fuel that will apply for the duration of such contract for the purposes of this subsection.  (d)  Maximum payment per year  (1)  In general  The amount of payments to an entity under a contract entered into under this section (other than a payment described in subsection (c)(4)) shall not exceed $50,000,000 per year.  (2)  Payment adjustment  Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary may increase the maximum amount of payments described in paragraph (1) to an entity to up to $100,000,000 per year, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.  (e)  Applications  To be eligible to enter into a contract under this section, an entity shall submit an application to the Secretary that includes—  (1)  a description of the applicable project;  (2)  the location of any facility included in the project;  (3)  the method of production, including expected feedstocks, and expected cost, of eligible hydrogen to be used in the project;  (4)  a description of any infrastructure and equipment investments, including modification, conversion, and retooling, that will be done to support increased use of eligible hydrogen at any facility of the project;  (5)  an estimate of annualized expected greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of the eligible hydrogen expected to be used in the project, calculated using methods and procedures determined appropriate by the Secretary; and  (6)  any additional information determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.
