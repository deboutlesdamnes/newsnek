 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  The public has a right to know the benefits and costs of regulation. Effective regulatory programs provide important benefits to the public, including protecting the environment, worker safety, and human health. Regulations also impose significant costs on individuals, employers, and State, local, and Tribal governments, diverting resources from other important priorities.  (2)  Better regulatory analysis and review should improve the quality of agency decisions, increasing the benefits and reducing unwarranted costs of regulation.  (3)  Disclosure and scrutiny of key information underlying agency decisions should make the Federal Government more accountable to the public it serves.
