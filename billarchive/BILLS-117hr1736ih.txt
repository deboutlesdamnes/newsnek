 2.  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  Beyond Traffic 2045, a comprehensive assessment of the national transportation system recently published by the Department of Transportation, identified transportation trends that need to be proactively addressed, including—  (A)  the population of the United States will increase by 70,000,000 during the 30-year period ending in 2045;  (B)  emerging megaregions could absorb 75 percent of the United States population by 2050;  (C)  freight volume will increase by more than 40 percent by 2045;  (D)  Americans are currently stuck in traffic for more than 42 hours each year, on average;  (E)  the current annual cost of congestion in delays and lost fuel amounts to $160,000,000,000;  (F)  96 people die in motor vehicle crashes in the United States every day, on average, and nearly 6,700 are injured per day; and  (G)  connected vehicles and new crash avoidance technology could potentially address 81 percent of crashes involving unimpaired drivers.  (2)  According to the Department of Transportation, in 2015—  (A)  traffic crash-related deaths increased by more than 7 percent compared to 2014;  (B)  pedestrian fatalities increased by more than 9 percent compared to 2014; and  (C)  pedalcyclist fatalities increased by more than 12 percent compared to 2014.  (3)  In 2015, the Secretary of Transportation created the Smart City Challenge to assist cities in addressing the challenges facing our Nation’s transportation system through innovative and creative means, utilizing both the public and the private sectors.  (4)  By asking American cities to use emerging transportation technologies to address their most pressing problems, the Smart City Challenge aimed to spark and spread innovation through a mixture of collaboration, competition, and experimentation.  (5)  The following outcomes were expected from the original Smart City Challenge and are expected to result from the SMART grants awarded under this Act:  (A)  Improved safety from the use of advanced technologies, including connected vehicle technologies, to reduce the number of collisions, fatalities, and injuries for vehicle occupants and nonvehicle occupants.  (B)  Enhanced mobility by providing realtime traveler information and emerging mobility services to improve personal mobility for all citizens including people with lower incomes, people with disabilities, and older adults.  (C)  Enhanced ladders of opportunity by—  (i)  providing access to advanced technology and its benefits for underserved areas and residents;  (ii)  increasing connectivity to employment, education, and other services; and  (iii)  contributing to revitalization by incentivized reinvestment in underserved communities.  (D)  Reduction in pollution by implementing advanced technologies and policies that support a more sustainable and cost-effective relationship between transportation and the environment through more efficient fuel use and emissions reductions.
