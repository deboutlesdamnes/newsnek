 1.  Short title; findings  (a)  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Child Care is Infrastructure Act . (b)  Findings  Congress makes the following findings:  (1)  Early care and learning settings directly impact the physical, behavioral, and cognitive development of young children, and these settings should be designed and equipped to keep children safe and help children thrive.  (2)  An investigation in 10 States conducted by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services found that 96 percent of early care and learning facilities inspected during unannounced visits had at least 1 potentially hazardous condition.  (3) Approximately 500,000 early care and learning facilities are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act ( 42 U.S.C. 300f ), and only 11 States and New York City require licensed early care and learning facilities to test drinking water within such facilities for lead. (4)  A Department of Health and Human Services report from 2015 found that an estimated 2,201 Head Start centers needed facility improvements, including improvements related to rebuilding, renovating, and conducting maintenance on such facilities.  (5)  Only 2 statewide needs assessments have been conducted:  (A)  A 2011 statewide study of Massachusetts early care and learning facilities found excessive levels of carbon dioxide in early care and learning facilities throughout the State, insufficient ventilation systems, and furnishings containing formaldehyde.  (B)  A 2014 statewide study in Rhode Island found that—  (i)  all centers visited had at least one playground safety hazard;  (ii)  centers in poor condition tend to serve higher rates of low-income, State-subsidized children; and  (iii)  nearly 70 percent of early learning centers visited had one or more issues related to the overall building condition, such as water stains, excessive wear, and peeling paint.  (6)  The National Children’s Facilities Network estimates that the United States would require at least $14 billion to bring existing early care and learning facilities up to professional standards.  (7)  While data on the condition of facilities is available for 2 States, it is lacking elsewhere. The extent of the problem is impossible to determine without a nationwide assessment of the current condition of existing early care and learning facilities.  (8)  In 2019, a member of the child care workforce earned a median pay of $24,230 per year, or $11.65 per hour, below the Federal poverty rate for a family of four, which was $26,200 in 2020.   (9)  Over half of the child care workforce is enrolled in at least one main public benefit program—Medicaid, CHIP, EITC, SNAP, or TANF—compared to 21 percent of the United States population.  (10)  Poor compensation is associated with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover rates. In absence of quality wages and benefits, the early childhood field will continue to struggle to recruit and retain its workforce.   (11)  Child care workers who have lower educational attainment, work with infants and toddlers, or come from communities of color earn a lower average wage than their counterparts in the profession.   (12)  Child care workers caring for children from ages 3 to 5 have a slightly higher educational attainment with 45 percent earning a bachelor’s degree compared to just 19 percent of those teaching younger children. One-third or 34 percent of home-based providers have no higher education and an additional one-third have some college-level education but did not complete a higher education degree.  (13)  Systemic barriers hamper access to higher education and training for people of color, continuing to affect wages and upward mobility within any given career field including child care. Efforts to address barriers to higher education in the early childhood workforce is critical in increasing diversity across all roles.   (14)  In the early childhood workforce, 94 percent of workers are women with more than one in five being foreign-born, 15 percent being Black, 21 percent being Hispanic. In total, 40 percent of child care workers are people of color.
