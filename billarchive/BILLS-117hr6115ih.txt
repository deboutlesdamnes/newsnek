 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Disclosing All Spending That Ensures Relief Act  or the  DISASTER Act .
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  At a time of constrained budgets, it is fiscally prudent to understand the amount and the scope of the Federal Government’s funding and outlays relating to disasters and emergencies affecting communities in need.  (2)  Understanding the funding and outlays of Federal agencies relating to disasters and emergencies will help better inform the congressional funding process and presidential budget requests.  (3)  Knowledge about funding and outlay trends relating to disasters and emergencies will guide mitigation efforts that reduce vulnerabilities to future disasters and emergencies.  (4)  Any accounting mechanism to track outlays relating to disasters and emergencies should account for all funding sources, including both procurement and financial assistance funding, regardless of how that funding is appropriated.  (5)  The Federal Government’s fiscal exposure to disasters and emergencies is not limited to the funding and outlays of Federal agencies and should also include financial damages associated with disasters and emergencies. For example, financial damages associated with wildfires may exceed the amount that Federal agencies actually spend in response to wildfires. The difference in damages and outlays illustrates the Federal Government’s fiscal exposure to wildfires. Although some Federal agencies currently track financial damages associated with disasters and emergencies, this tracking should be consistent and standardized across all relevant Federal agencies.  (6)  Data quality issues in business systems used by Federal agencies and recipients of Federal awards hinder analysis and learning opportunities about funding and outlays relating to disasters and emergencies. 
 3.  Purpose  The purpose of this Act is to require—  (1)  relevant Federal agencies and components of Federal agencies to track and report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury data on funding, outlays, and, to the extent practicable, financial damages relating to disasters and emergencies for publication on a centralized website;  (2)  the Comptroller General to study and recommend data quality remediation measures for the data sources of the website described in paragraph (1); and  (3)  if applicable, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury to implement the data quality remediation measures described in paragraph (2).
