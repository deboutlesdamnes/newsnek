 2.  Sense of Congress that the United States should not reenter the Paris Agreement absent further negotiations and advice and consent to ratification of the United States Senate  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  On May 9, 1992, the United States Senate provided its advice and consent to ratification regarding the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Framework Convention), which entered into force on March 21, 1994.  (2)  The Framework Convention was ratified under the express limitation that a decision by the Conference of the Parties to adopt targets and timetables would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent.  (3)  The Kyoto Protocol, completed at the 3d Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Framework Convention in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, contains emissions targets and timetables, and was signed by the Clinton Administration on behalf of the United States but never submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification.  (4) The United Nations Climate Change website states:  The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. . And yet this United Nations designated  legally binding international treaty  has never been submitted to the United States Senate for advice and consent as required of treaties under article II, section 2 of the Constitution. (5)  The Paris Agreement and every article and clause thereof was accepted by President Barack Obama on behalf of the United States solely through executive action, rather than submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification.  (6)  Implementation of the Paris Agreement would serve as justification for pursuing unilateral and punitive policies harmful to United States economic competitiveness, including significant job loss, increased energy and consumer costs, risks to grid reliability, or any combination thereof.  (7) When originally negotiating the Paris Agreement, incoming Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry stated, if …  all the industrial nations went down to zero emissions, it wouldn’t be enough, not when more than 65 percent of the world’s carbon pollution comes from the developing world . (8)  The Paris Agreement allows the People’s Republic of China, the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, to continue as a developing country, and therefore justify energy and industrial policies that undermine the economic and security interests of the United States and its allies, and significantly increase emissions in the foreseeable future.   (9)  The People’s Republic of China is on track to increase its emissions by roughly 50 percent by 2030, consistent with the 2014 agreement with the Obama Administration and its pledge under the Paris Agreement.  (10)  Since 2005 the People’s Republic of China increased emissions by four tons for every ton of emissions reduced by the United States during the same period.  (11)  To protect the interests of the United States and its citizens, prior to its submission to the United States Senate for its advice and consent to ratification, the Paris Agreement should be renegotiated or new agreement negotiated to ensure the People’s Republic of China reduces greenhouse gas emissions at a pace and scale equivalent to that of the United States.  (12)  Through innovation and free market forces, the United States has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than any other country in the world, including the next 12 emissions-reducing countries combined over the past 15 years.  (13)  Between 1994 and 2018, global greenhouse gas emissions grew significantly despite nearly a quarter century of international climate agreements and in spite of the United States, the European Union and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G7 nations reducing their emissions during the same time period.  (14)  The emissions reduction goals of the Paris Agreement cannot be met without the development and global deployment of affordable energy technologies, including storage, nuclear, and clean fossil technologies, as well as commercial-scale carbon, capture, utilization, and storage technologies.  (15)  American economic growth and prosperity is essential to the development and deployment of these technologies to address global energy security and reduction of global emissions. Punitive policies such as taxes, mandates and regulations that increase the cost of energy and American manufacturing will divert resources from the innovation of affordable technologies necessary to reduce global emissions.   (16)  Global competitors to exported American liquified natural gas, such as Russian produced natural gas, have lifecycle emissions up to 50 percent higher than American exported liquified natural gas, and domestic policies such as taxes, mandates, regulations or banning of the domestically produced energy resource will result in higher global emissions and run counter to the goals of international efforts to reduce emissions all while hurting America’s competitiveness, security, and economic interests.  (17)  The United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, which President Donald J. Trump first announced on June 1, 2017, and took effect on November 4, 2020.  (18)  On January 20, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed an Executive order providing for the United States to reenter the Paris Agreement.  (b)  Sense of Congress  It is the sense of Congress that the United States should not reenter the Paris Agreement and Congress should refuse to consider any budget resolutions and appropriations language that include funding for the Green Climate Fund or any affiliated body or financing mechanism—  (1)  until the Paris Agreement is renegotiated, or a new agreement is reached, in a manner that would result in all major emitters, including the People’s Republic of China, reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to levels comparable to the United States; and  (2)  unless such agreement—  (A)  is submitted to the United States Senate for its advice and consent to ratification; and  (B)  subsequently approved by the United States Senate exercising its responsibilities under Article II of the Constitution of the United States. 
 3.  Rules of construction relating to Paris Agreement  (a)  Relating to Paris Agreement  Nothing in the Paris Agreement may be used to establish or demonstrate the existence of a violation of United States law or an offense against the law of nations in United States courts, including—  (1)  to establish standing, a cause of action, or a source of damages as a matter of law; or  (2)  to demonstrate whether an action by a Federal agency is arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.   (b)  Relating to this Act  Nothing in subsection (a) may be construed to modify or limit any obligation of the United States pursuant to an international treaty that was ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
 4.
