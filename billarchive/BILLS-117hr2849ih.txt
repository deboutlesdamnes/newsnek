 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1) The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( Public Law 116–136 ) disqualified affiliations from applying for and receiving loans through the paycheck protection program established under section 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36) ).  (2) Section 7(a)(36)(D)(vi) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 7(a)(36)(D)(vi) ), as added by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, established that affiliation rules apply to nonprofits for the purpose of determining whether a nonprofit has 500 or fewer employees.  (3)  Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a national organization with central control over its affiliates and which has nearly $2,000,000,000 in assets and 16,000 employees, improperly applied for, and received $80,000,000 in loans through the paycheck protection program.  (4)  In May of 2020, the Small Business Administration sent letters to the 39 Planned Parenthood affiliates who had improperly applied for and received funds under the paycheck protection program contrary to the letter of the law, instructing the affiliates to return the funding.  (5)  According to the most recently available data, 7 affiliates did so, but the remaining 31 affiliates kept the received funding despite receiving notice that they had received such funds illegally.  (6) As of March 23, 2021, 3 of the 31 Planned Parenthood affiliates again applied for and received second draw loans under section 7(a)(37) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(37) ) for a combined $4,800,000 of additional funding.
