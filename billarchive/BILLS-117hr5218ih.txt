Incentivizing primary care uptake of the collaborative care model  (a)  Grants  The Secretary shall make grants to primary health care physicians and primary health care practices to meet the initial costs of establishing and delivering behavioral health integration services through the collaborative care model or a combined approach of the collaborative care model and primary care behavioral health integration models.  (b)  Use of grants  A primary health care physician or primary health care practice that receives a grant under this section shall use funds received through the grant—  (1)  to hire staff;  (2)  to identify and formalize contractual relationships with other health care providers, including providers who will function as psychiatric consultants and behavioral health care managers in providing behavioral health integration services through the collaborative care model;  (3)  to purchase or upgrade software and other resources needed to appropriately provide behavioral health integration services through the collaborative care model, including resources needed to establish a patient registry and implement measurement-based care; and  (4)  for other such purposes that the Secretary may determine to be necessary.  (c)  Priority  In making grants under this section, the Secretary shall give priority to primary health care physicians and primary health care practices—  (1)  providing services to any medically underserved population; and  (2)  are located in areas with a prevalence of mental illnesses or substance use disorders that are higher than the national average.  (d)  Consideration If, in reviewing applications for grants under this section, the Secretary determines that more than one primary health care physician or a primary health care practice submitting such an application meets the criteria to be given priority under subsection (c), the Secretary shall give a preference to the primary health care physician or primary health care practice (that meets such criteria) that has the least existing capacity and resources to use grant funds as described in subsection (b).  (e)  Incentive payments  (1)  In general  The Secretary shall provide to primary health care physicians and primary health care practices receiving a grant under this section that meet the criteria specified in paragraph (3), additional payments.

Such criteria shall include whether—  (A)  a primary health care physician or primary health care practice participates in an alternative payment model that bills for the collaborative care model using the appropriate common procedural terminology billing codes; and  (B)  a primary health care physician or primary health care practice uses of validated quality measures, including, but not limited to, those related to depression screening, patient follow up, and symptom remission.  (4)  Calculation  A payment received under this subsection shall not be factored into any determination with respect to meeting cost reduction targets for purposes of a model implemented pursuant to section 1115A of the Social Security Act.   (f)  Accountability  The recipient of a grant under this section shall submit to the Secretary, in such time and manner as the Secretary may specify, a report that measures each recipient’s progress toward—  (1)  implementing and appropriately providing behavioral health integration services through the collaborative care model;  (2)  improving access to behavioral health integration services provided through the collaborative care model among medically underserved populations;  (3)  improving health outcomes for individuals who receive behavioral health integration services provided through the collaborative care model; and  (4)  other such purposes that the Secretary may determine to be necessary.  (g)  Clarification  (1)  Reimbursement  Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a primary health care physician or primary health care practice that receives a grant under this section from receiving direct reimbursement for rendering behavioral health integration services through the collaborative care model.  (2)  Other programs  Participation in, or application for, any other grant or demonstration program administered by the Secretary by a primary health care physician or primary health care practice shall not affect the eligibility of such physician or practice to receive a grant under this section.
