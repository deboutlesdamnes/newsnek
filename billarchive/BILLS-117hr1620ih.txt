 VII  Economic Security for Victims  701.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual violence, and 1 in 5 women have survived completed or attempted rape. Such violence has a devastating impact on women’s physical and emotional health, financial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic security.  (2)  The Office on Violence Against Women of the Department of Justice defines domestic violence as a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one intimate partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner. Domestic violence can include physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person. Domestic violence includes any behaviors that intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, terrorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or wound an individual.  (3)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that domestic violence or intimate partner violence is a serious public health issue for millions of individuals in the United States. Nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men in the United States have suffered sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner.  (4)  Transgender and gender non-conforming people face extraordinary levels of physical and sexual violence.  (5)  More than 1 in 4 transgender people have faced bias-driven assault, and this rate is higher for trans women and trans people of color.  (6)  The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has found that transgender and gender non-conforming people had an elevated prevalence of suicide attempts, especially when they have suffered physical or sexual violence.  (7)  Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women on the job. Domestic partners or relatives commit 43 percent of workplace homicides against women. One study found that intimate partner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 workplace homicides among women during the period. In fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work increased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in overall workplace homicides in recent years.  (8)  Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to be murdered with guns than women in other high-income countries. Female intimate partners are more likely to be murdered with a firearm than all other means combined. The presence of a gun in domestic violence situations increases the risk of homicide for women by 500 percent.  (9)  Violence can have a dramatic impact on the survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that 44 percent of surveyed employed adults experienced the effect of domestic violence in the workplace, and 64 percent indicated their workplace performance was affected by such violence. Another recent survey found that 78 percent of offenders used workplace resources to express anger, check up on, pressure, or threaten a survivor. Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the workplace, can impair an employee’s work performance, require time away from work, and undermine the employee’s ability to maintain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.  (10)  Studies find that 60 percent of single women lack economic security and 81 percent of households with single mothers live in economic insecurity. Significant barriers that survivors confront include access to housing, transportation, and child care. Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced domestic violence, and more than 50 percent of such women cite domestic violence as the direct cause for homelessness. Survivors are deprived of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and face tremendous threats to their health and safety.  (11)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that survivors of severe intimate partner violence lose nearly 8 million days of paid work, which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full-time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household productivity each year. Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for their health or to find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further violence.  (12)  Annual costs of intimate partner violence are estimated to be more than $8,300,000,000. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the costs of intimate partner violence against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated $5,800,000,000. These costs included nearly $4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical and mental health care and nearly $1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost productivity. These statistics are generally considered to be underestimated because the costs associated with the criminal justice system are not included.  (13)  Fifty-five percent of senior executives recently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company’s productivity, and more than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively affects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human resources professionals consider partner violence a workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of United States workplaces have no formal program or policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone domestic violence. In fact, only four percent of employers provided training on domestic violence.  (14)  Studies indicate that one of the best predictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or her economic independence. However, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking often negatively impact a survivor’s ability to maintain employment.  (15)  Abusers frequently seek to exert financial control over their partners by actively interfering with their ability to work, including preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their partners at work, limiting their partners’ access to cash or transportation, and sabotaging their partners’ child care arrangements.  (16)  Economic abuse refers to behaviors that control an intimate partner’s ability to acquire, use, and maintain access to, money, credit, ownership of assets, or access to governmental or private financial benefits, including defaulting on joint obligations (such as school loans, credit card debt, mortgages, or rent). Other forms of such abuse may include preventing someone from attending school, threatening to or actually terminating employment, controlling or withholding access to cash, checking, or credit accounts, and attempting to damage or sabotage the creditworthiness of an intimate partner, including forcing an intimate partner to write bad checks, forcing an intimate partner to default on payments related to household needs, such as housing, or forcing an intimate partner into bankruptcy.  (17) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Public Law 111–148 ), and the amendments made by such Act, ensures that most health plans must cover preventive services, including screening and counseling for domestic violence, at no additional cost. In addition, it prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against patients for preexisting conditions, like domestic violence. (18)  Yet, more can be done to help survivors. Federal law in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act does not explicitly—  (A)  authorize survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work to seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or assistance with safety planning activities;  (B)  address the eligibility of survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for unemployment compensation;  (C)  provide job protection to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking;  (D)  prohibit insurers and employers who self-insure employee benefits from discriminating against survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and those who help them in determining eligibility, rates charged, and standards for payment of claims; or  (E)  prohibit insurers from disclosing information about abuse and the location of the survivors through insurance databases and other means.  (19)  This Act aims to empower survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be free from violence, hardship, and control, which restrains basic human rights to freedom and safety in the United States.

 IX  Safety for Indian Women  901.  Findings and purposes  (a)  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes—and at least 2 times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault crimes—compared to all other races.  (2)  More than 4 in 5 American Indian and Alaska Native women, or 84.3 percent, have experienced violence in their lifetime.  (3)  The vast majority of Native victims—96 percent of women and 89 percent of male victims—report being victimized by a non-Indian.  (4)  Native victims of sexual violence are three times as likely to have experienced sexual violence by an interracial perpetrator as non-Hispanic White victims and Native stalking victims are nearly 4 times as likely to be stalked by someone of a different race.  (5)  While Tribes exercising jurisdiction over non-Indians have reported significant successes, the inability to prosecute crimes related to the Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction crimes continues to leave Tribes unable to fully hold domestic violence offenders accountable.  (6)  Tribal prosecutors report that the majority of domestic violence cases involve children either as witnesses or victims, and Department of Justice reports that American Indian and Alaska Native children suffer exposure to violence at rates higher than any other race in the United States.  (7)  Childhood exposure to violence has immediate and long-term effects, including: increased rates of altered neurological development, poor physical and mental health, poor school performance, substance abuse, and overrepresentation in the juvenile justice system.  (8)  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide is the third leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska Native women between 10 and 24 years of age and the fifth leading cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years of age.  (9)  On some reservations, Indian women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average.  (10)  According to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report, United States Attorneys declined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent crimes that occur in Indian country.  (11)  Investigation into cases of missing and murdered Indian women is made difficult for Tribal law enforcement agencies due to a lack of resources, such as—  (A)  necessary training, equipment, or funding;  (B)  a lack of interagency cooperation; and  (C)  a lack of appropriate laws in place.  (12)  Domestic violence calls are among the most dangerous calls that law enforcement receives.  (13)  The complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in Indian country—  (A)  has a significant negative impact on the ability to provide public safety to Indian communities;  (B)  has been increasingly exploited by criminals; and  (C)  requires a high degree of commitment and cooperation among Tribal, Federal, and State law enforcement officials.  (14)  Restoring and enhancing local, Tribal capacity to address violence against women provides for greater local control, safety, accountability, and transparency.  (15) In States with restrictive land settlement acts such as Alaska,  Indian country  is limited, resources for local Tribal responses either nonexistent or insufficient to meet the needs, jurisdiction unnecessarily complicated and increases the already high levels of victimization of American Indian and Alaska Native women. According to the Tribal Law and Order Act Commission Report, Alaska Native women are over-represented in the domestic violence victim population by 250 percent; they comprise 19 percent of the State population, but are 47 percent of reported rape victims. And among other Indian Tribes, Alaska Native women suffer the highest rates of domestic and sexual violence in the country. (b)  Purposes  The purposes of this title are—  (1)  to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments with respect to responding to cases of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, trafficking, sexual violence, crimes against children, and assault against Tribal law enforcement officers and murdered Indians;  (2)  to increase coordination and communication among Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;  (3)  to empower Tribal governments with the resources and information necessary to effectively respond to cases of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sex trafficking, sexual violence, and missing and murdered Indians; and  (4)  to increase the collection of data related to missing and murdered Indians and the sharing of information among Federal, State, and Tribal officials responsible for responding to and investigating cases of missing and murdered Indians. 
 902.  Authorizing funding for the Tribal access program  (a)  In General  Section 534 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:  (g)  Authorization of appropriations  There is authorized to be appropriated $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, to remain available until expended, for the purposes of enhancing the ability of Tribal government entities to access, enter information into, and obtain information from, Federal criminal information databases, as authorized by this section.  .

 XVI  Keeping Children Safe from Family Violence  1601.  Short title This title may be cited as the  Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act  or  Kayden’s Law . 
 1602.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Approximately 15 million children are exposed each year to domestic violence and/or child abuse.  (2)  Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and by a parent. Intimate partner violence and child abuse overlap in the same families at rates of 30 to 60 percent. A child’s risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner violence separates from their domestic partner, even when the perpetrator had not previously directly abused the child. Children who have witnessed intimate partner violence are approximately four times more likely to experience direct child maltreatment than children who have not witnessed intimate partner violence.  (3)  More than 75 percent of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by a family member or a person known to the child. U.S. Department of Justice data shows that family members are almost half (49 percent) of the perpetrators of child sex assault victims under age 6.   (4)  Research suggests a child’s exposure to a batterer is among the strongest indicators of risk of incest victimization. One study found female children whose fathers were batterers of the mother were six-and-a-half times more likely to experience father-daughter incest than female children who do not have an abusive father.  (5)  Child abuse is a major public health issue in the United States. Total lifetime financial costs associated with just one year of confirmed cases of child maltreatment (including child physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse and neglect) results in $124 billion in annual costs to the U.S. economy, or approximately one percent of the gross domestic product.  (6) Empirical research indicates that allegations of child physical and sexual abuse are regularly discounted by courts when raised in child custody cases, with fewer than one-fourth of claims that a father has committed child physical or sexual abuse believed; and where the allegedly abusive parent claimed the mother was  alienating  the child, only 1 out of 51 claims of sexual molestation by a father were believed. Independent research indicates that child sexual abuse allegations are credible 50 to 70 percent of the time. (7)  Empirical research shows that alleged or known abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected parenting time by courts. Approximately one-third of parents alleged to have committed child abuse took primary custody from the protective parent reporting the abuse, placing children at ongoing risk.  (8)  Researchers have documented nearly 800 children murdered in the United States since 2008 by a divorcing or separating parent. More than 100 of these child murders are known to have occurred after a court ordered the child into contact with the dangerous parent over the objection of a safe parent or caregiver.  (9)  Scientifically unsound theories that treat mothers’ abuse allegations as likely false attempts to undermine the father are frequently applied in family court to minimize or deny parents’ and children’s reports of abuse. Many experts who testify against abuse allegations lack expertise in the relevant type of alleged abuse, relying instead on unsound and unproven theories.  (10)  Judges presiding over custody cases with allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and domestic violence are rarely required to receive training on these subjects, nor have most states established standards for such trainings. 
 1603.  Purposes  The purposes of this title are to:  (1)  increase the priority given to child safety in any private state court proceeding affecting children’s care and custody, excluding child protective and social service proceedings;  (2)  strengthen courts’ abilities to recognize and adjudicate domestic violence and child abuse allegations based on valid, admissible evidence, and to enter orders which protect and minimize the risk of harm to children as the first priority; and  (3)  ensure that professional personnel involved in cases containing abuse allegations receive trauma-informed and culturally appropriate training on the dynamics, signs and impact of domestic violence and child abuse, including child sexual abuse. 
 1604.  Definition of covered formula grant The term  covered formula grant  means a grant under part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 ( 34 U.S.C. 10441  et seq.) (commonly referred to as the  STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program ).
 1605.  Increased funding for formula grants authorized  (a)  In general  The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if—  (1)  Evidence  (A)  Experts  The State has in place a law ensuring that, in a custody proceeding where a parent has been alleged to have committed domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse, evidence from court-appointed or outside professionals regarding the alleged abuse may be admitted only when the professional possesses demonstrated expertise and clinical, not solely forensic, experience in working with victims of domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse.  (B)  Non-experts  The State has in place a law ensuring that, in a custody proceeding where a parent has been alleged to have committed domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse, evidence of past sexual or physical abuse committed by a party, including but not limited to any past or current protection from abuse orders, sexual violence abuse protection orders, arrests, or convictions, must be considered in determining the truth of any allegations of family violence.  (2)  Experts  The State has in place uniform required standards of domestic violence and child abuse expertise and experience for all court-appointed neutral professional opinions related to abuse, trauma, and the behaviors of victims and perpetrators, which meet the criteria in paragraph (1)(A).  (3)  Remedies for a child’s resistance to contact with a parent  The state has in place a law ensuring that—  (A)  No removal of care from safe parent  No child shall be removed from the care of a competent protective, non-physically or sexually abusive parent or litigating party to whom the child is bonded or attached, nor shall the child’s contact with such parent be restricted, solely in order to improve a deficient relationship with the other parent.  (B)  Reunification treatment No  reunification treatment  may be ordered by the court without scientifically valid and generally accepted proof of the safety, effectiveness and therapeutic value of the particular treatment, nor may any treatment predicated on cutting off a child from the parent to whom they are bonded or attached be ordered. (C)  Causes of child resistance  Any order to remediate a child’s contact resistance must address the resisted parent’s behaviors or contributions to the child’s resistance first, before ordering the preferred parent to take steps to potentially improve the child’s relationship with the parent they resist.  (4)  Training and education program  (A)  In general  The state has in place an ongoing education and training program for judges and magistrates who hear custody matters, and relevant court personnel, including guardians ad litem, best interest attorneys, counsel for children, custody evaluators, masters, and mediators, focusing solely on domestic violence and child abuse, including—  (i)  child sexual abuse;  (ii)  physical abuse;  (iii)  emotional abuse;  (iv)  coercive control;  (v)  implicit and explicit bias;  (vi)  trauma;  (vii)  long and short-term impacts of domestic violence and child abuse on children; and  (viii)  victim and perpetrator behaviors.  (B)  Providers  Training must be provided by —  (i)  professionals with substantial experience in assisting survivors of domestic violence or child abuse, such as a victim service provider; and   (ii)  where possible, survivors of domestic violence, or child physical or sexual abuse.   (C)  Evidence-based research  (i)  In general  The education and training program in subparagraph (A) shall rely on evidence-based and peer-reviewed research by recognized experts in the types of abuse designated under this section.  (ii)  Exclusion  The education and training program shall not include theories, concepts, and belief systems unsupported by valid, credible scientific research.  (C)  Objective of education and training program  The education and training program shall be designed to improve the ability of courts to recognize and respond to child physical abuse, child sexual abuse, domestic violence, and trauma on all family victims, particularly children, and make appropriate custody decisions that prioritize child safety and well-being, and shall be culturally sensitive and appropriate for diverse communities.  (D)  Training requirements  Judges and all other personnel identified in subparagraph (A) must receive at least 60 hours of initial training on these identified topics, and at least 20 hours of this ongoing training every two years.  (E)  Custody evaluator requirements  Prior to being appointed in a case, a custody evaluator shall, at a minimum, hold a Master’s degree in a relevant field and must have completed the training requirements of subparagraph (D).  (4)  Legal representation  The state shall notify parties of the importance of legal representation and shall direct the parties to appropriate resources.  (b)  Grant increase  The amount of the increase provided to a State under the covered formula grant under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the State under the covered formula grant under the 3 most recent awards to the State. 
 1606.  Application  A State seeking a grant under this title shall submit an application to the Attorney General at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, including information regarding the law described in section 1605. 
 1607.  Rule of construction  Nothing in this title shall be interpreted to discourage States from adopting additional provisions to increase safe outcomes for children; additional protective provisions are encouraged.  
 1608.  Grant term  (a)  In general  The term of a covered grant shall be for one year.  (b)  Renewal  A State that receives a covered grant may submit an application for a renewal of such grant at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Attorney General may reasonably require.  (c)  Limit  A State shall not receive a covered grant for more than 4 years. 
 1609.  Uses of funds A State that receives an increase under the covered formula grants under this title shall use the amount of the increase for subgrants pursuant to section 2007(c)(4)(C) or (D) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 ( 34 U.S.C. 10446(c)(4) ). 
 1610.  Authorization of appropriations  There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.
