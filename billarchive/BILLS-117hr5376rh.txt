(B)  Wage indexing  For individuals whose benefit period under this title begins in any calendar year after 2024, each of the amounts so established shall equal the corresponding amount established for the calendar year preceding such calendar year, or, if larger, the product of the corresponding amount established with respect to the calendar year 2024 and the quotient obtained by dividing—  (i)  the national average wage index (as defined in section 2212) for the second calendar year preceding such calendar year, by  (ii)  the national average wage index (as so defined) for 2022.  (C)  Rounding  Each amount established under subparagraph (B) for any calendar year shall be rounded to the nearest $1, except that any amount so established which is a multiple of $0.50 but not of $1 shall be rounded to the next higher $1.

(c)  Crediting of caregiving hours to a week  The number of caregiving hours of an individual credited to a week as determined under this subsection shall equal the number of caregiving hours of the individual occurring during such week, except that—  (1)  such number may not exceed the number of hours in a regular workweek of the individual (as determined in subsection (d));  (2)  no caregiving hours may be credited to a week in which fewer than 4 caregiving hours of the individual occur;  (3)  no caregiving hours of the individual may be credited to the individual’s waiting period, consisting of the first week during an individual’s benefit period in which at least 4 caregiving hours occur (regardless of whether the individual received paid vacation, paid sick leave, or any other form of accrued paid time off from the individual’s employer during such week in accordance with section 2202(c)(2)(B)); and  (4)  the total number of caregiving hours credited to weeks during the individual’s benefit period may not exceed the product of 12 multiplied by the number of hours in a regular workweek of the individual (as so determined).  (d)  Number of hours in a regular workweek  For purposes of this section, the number of hours in a regular workweek of an individual shall be the number of hours that the individual regularly works in a week for all employers (or regularly worked in the case of an individual no longer employed), as determined under guidance to be issued by the Secretary.

(2)  Waiver of certain overpayments  In any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any individual who was without fault in connection with the overpayment if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this title or would be against equity and good conscience, or would impede efficient or effective administration of this title, as determined by the Secretary under procedures to be established by the Secretary.  (3)  Liability of certifying or disbursing officer  No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him to any individual where the adjustment or recovery of such amount is waived under paragraph (2), or where adjustment under paragraph (1) is not completed prior to the death of the individual against whose benefits deductions are authorized.

(F)  Availability of records of excluded persons and entities  Nothing in this section shall be construed to have the effect of limiting access by any applicant or beneficiary under this title or the Secretary to records maintained by any person or entity in connection with services provided to the applicant or beneficiary prior to the exclusion of such person or entity under this paragraph.  (G)  Reporting Requirement  Any person or entity participating in, or seeking to participate in, the program under this title shall inform the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation, whether such person or entity has been convicted of a violation under paragraph (1).

(B)  Disregard of certain evidence  When redetermining the entitlement, or making an initial determination of entitlement, of an individual under this title, the Secretary shall disregard any evidence if there is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in the providing of such evidence.

(d)  Effective date  The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.  (e)  Normalization requirements  (1)  In general  A normalization method of accounting shall not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, reduces the tax reserve deficit less rapidly or to a lesser extent than such reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption method.  (2)  Alternative Method for Certain Taxpayers  If, as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of enactment of this Act—  (A)  the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency to compute depreciation for public utility property on the basis of an average life or composite rate method, and  (B)  the taxpayer’s books and underlying records did not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply the average rate assumption method,  the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer uses the alternative method for public utility property that is subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.   (3)  Definitions  For purposes of this subsection—  (A)  Tax reserve deficit The term  tax reserve deficit  means the excess of— (i) the amount which would be the balance in the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in  section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or section 167(l)(3)(G)(ii) of such Code as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) if the amount of such reserve were determined by assuming that the corporate rate increases provided in the amendments made by this section were in effect for all prior periods, over  (ii)  the balance in such reserve as of the day before such corporate rate increases take effect.  (B)  Average rate assumption method  The average rate assumption method is the method under which the excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over the remaining lives of the property as used in its regulated books of account which gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, if timing differences for the property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying—  (i)  the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the beginning of the period in question, by  (ii)  the amount of the timing differences which reverse during such period.  (C)  Alternative method The  alternative method  is the method in which the taxpayer— (i)  computes the tax reserve deficit on all public utility property included in the plant account on the basis of the weighted average life or composite rate used to compute depreciation for regulatory purposes, and  (ii)  reduces the tax reserve deficit ratably over the remaining regulatory life of the property.  (4)  Treatment of normalization violation If, for any taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of accounting, such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of  section 168  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  (5)  Regulations The Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary’s designee, shall issue such regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this subsection, including regulations or other guidance to provide appropriate coordination between this subsection, section 13001(d) of  Public Law 115–97 , and section 203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
