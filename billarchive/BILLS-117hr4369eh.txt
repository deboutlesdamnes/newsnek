 (D)  to develop best practices for designing and implementing advanced and continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes; and   (E)  to assess and respond to the national workforce needs for advanced and continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing, including the development and implementing of training programs. 
 (d)  Termination of designation  The Secretary may terminate the designation of any National Center of Excellence designated under this section if the Secretary determines such National Center of Excellence no longer meets the criteria specified in subsection (c). Not later than 90 days before the effective date of such a termination, the Secretary shall provide written notice to the National Center of Excellence, including the rationale for such termination.   (e)  Conditions for designation  As a condition of designation as a National Center of Excellence under this section, the Secretary shall require that an institution of higher education or consortium of institutions of higher education enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the institution or consortium agrees— 
 (1)  to collaborate directly with the Food and Drug Administration to publish the reports required by subsection (g);   (2)  to share data with the Food and Drug Administration regarding best practices and research generated through the funding under subsection (f); 
 (3)  to develop, along with industry partners (which may include large and small biopharmaceutical manufacturers, generic and nonprescription manufacturers, and contract research organizations or contract manufacturers that carry out drug development and manufacturing activities) and another institution or consortium designated under this section, if any, a roadmap for developing an advanced and continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing workforce;   (4)  to develop, along with industry partners and other institutions or consortia of such institutions designated under this section, a roadmap for strengthening existing, and developing new, relationships with other institutions of higher education or consortia thereof; and 
 (5)  to provide an annual report to the Food and Drug Administration regarding the institution’s or consortium’s activities under this section, including a description of how the institution or consortium continues to meet and make progress on the criteria specified in subsection (c).   (f)  Funding   (1)  In general  The Secretary shall award funding, through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements, to the National Centers of Excellence designated under this section for the purpose of studying and recommending improvements to advanced and continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing, including such improvements as may enable the Centers— 
 (A)  to continue to meet the conditions specified in subsection (e);    (B)  to expand capacity for research on, and development of, advanced and continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing; and
