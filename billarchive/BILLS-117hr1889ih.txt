 1.  Short title This Act may be cited as the  Environmental Justice for Coronavirus Affected Communities Act . 
 2.  Findings  Congress finds the following:  (1)  Communities of color, low-income communities, Tribal and indigenous communities, fossil fuel-dependent communities, and other vulnerable populations, such as persons with disabilities, children, and the elderly, are disproportionately burdened by environmental hazards that include exposure to polluted air, waterways, and landscapes.  (2)  Environmental justice disparities are also exhibited through a lack of equitable access to information and data on potential exposure to environmental hazards.  (3)  Communities experiencing environmental injustice have been subjected to systemic racial, social, and economic injustices and face a disproportionate burden of adverse human health or environmental effects, a higher risk of intentional, unconscious, and structural discrimination, and disproportionate energy burdens.  (4)  These disproportionate burdens are being exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic.  (5)  Citizen science will be essential for environmental justice communities to protect themselves during this pandemic.
