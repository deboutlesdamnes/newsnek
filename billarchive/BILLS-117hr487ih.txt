Report to the Congress  The Secretary of Agriculture shall commission a detailed and thorough national assessment of the employment and training programs carried out under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, consulting with experts, program providers, State and local stakeholders, and individuals with relevant lived experience across the country to determine what is working well, what is not working well, and to develop a strategy for continuous improvement, and shall report to the Congress on the Secretary’s findings not later than September 30, 2022, with a follow up assessment based on continuous feedback and learning not later than September 30, 2024. Such report shall include findings and recommendations on the following topics: 
 (1)  Strategies to more rigorously measure the impact of such program.   (2)  Strategies to improve the measurable impact of such programs on key outcomes, including employment, earnings and economic self-sufficiency outcomes for participants, and reporting measures related to these outcomes that States are required to track and report annually under regulations issued by the Secretary under such Act.

(4)  An assessment specifically of the amendments made by this Act, in particular the effect of allowing States and providers to use other Federal funding to satisfy the matching requirement applicable to such program (including how widespread this allowable use of other Federal funds has been used, whether and how that use has worked to incentivize local providers to coordinate programming effectively with other workforce and training providers funded through other Federal programs and with other providers of relevant supportive services, and the likely impact over time of extending that provision of law). 
 (5)  An assessment in particular of other provisions of the such amendments that will terminate in 2023, and how such other amendments were implemented by States, local governments, and providers.   (6)  An assessment of how many providers of such programs are opting into the heightened reimbursement authorized under other provisions of the such amendments.
